[02:48] Questions 4 through 6 refer to the following speech.
[02:54] Good morning, everyone.
[02:56] I'm calling this meeting to discuss the recent changes to our travel expense policy.

[03:00] As you know, we've been working to streamline our processes and ensure fair reimbursement
[03:05] for all employees.

[03:11] with original receipts.
[03:12] This includes hotel stays, flights, and the new travel expenses.

[03:28] but we believe it will ultimately benefit everyone.

[03:31] If you require any assistance with the new process or have questions,
