[01:51] Questions 4 through 6 refer to the following speech.
[02:11] Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to discuss an important aspect of our team's
[02:17] productivity, efficient task management. We've received feedback that many of you are

[02:22] spending a significant amount of time on administrative tasks, often referred to as paperwork. While
[02:28] necessary, we need to find ways to streamline these processes. To that end, we're going to
[02:34] emphasize the importance of effective delegation. By learning to properly delegate tasks to

[02:39] appropriate team members, we can ensure that everyone focuses on their core responsibilities
[02:44] and high priority projects. This will not only reduce the burden of administrative work but
[02:49] also empower team members and improve overall efficiency. We'll be holding a workshop next

[02:55] week to provide practical strategies for both delegating and taking on delegated tasks effectively.
[03:01] Thank you.
