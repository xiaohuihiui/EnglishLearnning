[06:25] Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following speech.
[06:29] Good morning, everyone. I'm here today to discuss the recent performance review of our
[06:34] marketing campaign. Overall, the campaign showed positive results, particularly in the increase

[06:41] in website traffic and social media engagement. However, there is one significant shortcoming
[06:46] we need to address. While our reach expanded, the conversion rate, meaning the percentage of
[06:52] visitors who made a purchase, remained disappointingly low. This suggests that although we attracted a

[06:58] lot of potential customers, we failed to effectively persuade them to buy our products.
[07:03] To improve this, I propose a shift in our strategy. We need to enhance our landing page
[07:09] content to be more compelling and implement a series of targeted online ads showcasing

[07:14] customer testimonials. I believe these adjustments will make our message clearer and more persuasive.
[07:21] Before moving forward with these changes, we need the leadership team to approve this plan.
[07:26] Your support and insights will be invaluable as we move forward.

[07:30] I'm confident that these improvements will lead to a more successful campaign in the future.
[07:35] Thank you.
