[06:50] Hi, everyone. Today, I'd like to talk about our new marketing strategy.
[06:54] Recent market research shows that consumers are less willing to purchase than before, and are particularly cautious about high priced items.

[07:02] Therefore, we've concluded that we need a more asterisk persuasive asterisk approach that resonates directly with consumers minds.
[07:10] Specifically, we will not only emphasize the benefits of our products, but also highlight their role as solutions to consumers problems.
[07:18] For example, taking our new vacuum cleaner as an example, we'll emphasize that it is not only more powerful than conventional vacuum cleaners, but also effective in combating allergies.

[07:29] In addition, we'll emphasize that we are actively using recycled materials as an environmentally conscious measure.
[07:36] However, since consumers tend to be asterisk-reluctant asterisk to try new things, we believe it's important to offer free trials and a money-back guarantee at first,
[07:46] and to minimize the risks and let them try our products. This will help to alleviate consumers anxiety and allow them to experience the value of our products.

[07:55] Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
