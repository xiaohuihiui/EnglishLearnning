[04:06] Questions 7 through 9 refer to the following speech.
[04:23] Good morning, everyone. Today, I'd like to update you on the progress of our new digital

[04:28] archiving system. The primary goal of this system is to prevent the unnecessary creation
[04:34] of duplicate files across all departments. We've often found that different teams unintentionally
[04:40] store multiple copies of the same document, leading to confusion and wasted storage space.

[04:46] This new system will automatically detect and consolidate these redundant files,
[04:50] ensuring that everyone works with the most current version. Furthermore, it will significantly
[04:55] improve information flow between our main office and each branch location, allowing for seamless

[05:01] data access and collaboration. We anticipate a smooth transition and training sessions will
[05:07] be announced shortly. Thank you.
