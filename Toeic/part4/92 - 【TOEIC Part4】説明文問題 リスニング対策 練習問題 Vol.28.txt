[00:00] Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following speech.
[00:25] Hello everyone and thank you for coming to this meeting.
[00:28] Today, I'd like to discuss some recent changes in our product line.

[00:32] As you know, we've been working hard to innovate and improve our offerings.
[00:36] One of the key areas we've focused on is streamlining our products to better meet customer needs.
[00:41] In this effort, we've made the difficult decision to discontinue the Z-Series model

[00:45] at the end of this quarter. This decision was based on its declining sales performance and the
[00:50] increased cost of production. However, this will free up resources, allowing us to boost the
[00:55] production of our highly successful X-Series. We will also be introducing a new accessory line

[01:01] specifically designed for the X-Series, which we believe will further enhance its appeal.
[01:06] We're confident these changes will position us for stronger future growth.
[01:09] Let's now move to the Q&A session.
