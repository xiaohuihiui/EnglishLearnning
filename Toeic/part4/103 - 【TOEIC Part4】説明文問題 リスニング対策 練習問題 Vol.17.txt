[02:11] Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's team meeting.
[02:14] I want to start by reviewing our recent marketing campaign.
[02:17] While it was generally successful, we did encounter some challenges.

[02:21] Firstly, the online advertisements didn't perform as well as we hoped, and the social
[02:25] media engagement was somewhat lower than anticipated.
[02:29] This is something we need to address in our next campaign.

[02:32] Secondly, we noticed that our booth at the trade show was extremely crowded, which is
[02:36] great in terms of visibility but created some difficulties for our sales team to have quality
[02:40] conversations with potential clients.

[02:43] We also need to take a look at all submitted R, sum, S, as we are getting ready to start
[02:48] the interview process.
[02:50] We'll need to schedule interviews for those individuals we feel are the best fit for the

[02:54] open positions we have.
[02:56] So please make sure to review these R, sum, S in the next few days.
[03:01] Finally, I want to encourage everyone to share their ideas on how to improve our future marketing

[03:05] strategies.
