[00:00] Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following speech.
[00:25] Good morning, everyone. I'm excited to announce some changes to our project timeline.
[00:30] We've decided to consolidate the first two phases into one to streamline our process.

[00:35] This means we'll be working more intensively in the coming weeks, but it will allow us to move into the implementation phase much faster.
[00:43] We've also created a new document that explicitly outlines each team's responsibilities, so please take some time to review that.
[00:50] This clarity should help us avoid any confusion and ensure everyone is on the same page.

[00:55] We'll have a team meeting next week to discuss this in more detail. Thank you.

[03:48] Hello, everyone.
[03:49] Today, I'd like to talk about some important events that have recently occurred at our
[03:54] institution.

[03:55] First, I want to discuss how our university contributes to the local community.
[04:00] Our university offers various programs to strengthen collaboration with the community.
[04:05] For example, we have internship programs in cooperation with local companies, providing

[04:10] opportunities for students to gain real-world work experience.
[04:15] In addition, we regularly hold public lectures for local residents, supporting lifelong learning.
[04:21] Next, I want to address the challenges that this university faces.

[04:25] Recently, the number of students has increased, leading to a shortage of facilities such as
[04:30] classrooms and libraries.
[04:33] Therefore, the university is currently planning the construction of a new building, which is

[04:37] scheduled to be completed next year.
[04:40] Finally, regarding future prospects, we aim to further strengthen collaboration with the
[04:45] local community and contribute to its development.

[04:48] We also aim to further improve the quality of education and develop students who can
[04:53] succeed in society in the future.
[04:55] To achieve these goals, your understanding and cooperation are essential.

[05:00] Thank you for your attention.

[06:26] Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following speech.

[06:48] Good morning, everyone.
[06:50] I'm delighted to be here today to talk about our new project.
[06:53] Over the past few months, we have been thoroughly researching the needs in the market, and as

[06:57] a result, we have developed a completely different, innovative solution.
[07:02] This new system is particularly beneficial for small and medium-sized businesses, and
[07:06] it aims to simplify processes that have been very complex and costly in the past.

[07:11] We are confident that this system is applicable in many industries and has the potential to
[07:15] significantly improve operational efficiency.
[07:18] For more details, please feel free to ask questions during the queue and a session later.

[07:23] Now, let's start the demonstration.

[08:16] Questions 13 through 15 refer to the following speech.

[08:37] Good morning, everyone.
[08:38] I'm here today to talk about our new inventory management system.
[08:41] As you know, maintaining an accurate record of our stock is crucial for efficient operations.

[08:47] Our old system often led to discrepancies, causing delays and unnecessary costs.
[08:52] With this new system, we will be able to track every item separately, from the moment it
[08:56] arrives at our warehouse to when it's shipped out to our customers.

[09:00] This real-time tracking capability will allow us to identify any issues immediately and
[09:05] make better informed decisions.
[09:07] The training for this new system will be held next week, so please sign up through the HR

[09:11] portal by the end of this week.
