[00:00] Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following speech.
[00:25] Good morning, everyone. I'm here today to announce an exciting new chapter for our company.
[00:31] As you know, our current main office building, Plant A, has served us well for many years,

[00:36] but it no longer meets our evolving needs. Therefore, we've decided to demolish the
[00:41] old structure next month to make way for a state-of-the-art innovation hub. This new
[00:46] facility will not only provide advanced research labs but also feature open-plan workspaces

[00:52] designed to foster collaboration. Furthermore, we understand that a modern workplace requires
[00:58] a modern approach to work-life balance. To that end, we are introducing more flexible
[01:03] working arrangements, including options for remote work and staggered hours, starting

[01:08] from the completion of the new building. We believe these changes will significantly
[01:13] enhance our productivity and employee satisfaction. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation
[01:19] during this transition period. Thank you.
