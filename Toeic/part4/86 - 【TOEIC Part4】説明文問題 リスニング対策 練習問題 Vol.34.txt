[00:00] Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following speech.
[00:25] Good morning, everyone. I'm here today to discuss our new initiative to streamline the
[00:30] project approval process. We've noticed that in the past, the steps involved have often

[00:35] been unclear, leading to delays and frustration. Therefore, we're implementing a new digital
[00:41] platform that will guide you through each stage of the process. This platform will provide
[00:46] a checklist, automated reminders, and a clear feedback loop. Our goal is to not only speed

[00:52] up the process, but also to foster a more transparent and collaborative work environment.
[00:58] We believe that by simplifying the approval process, we can all focus more on our core
[01:03] tasks and achieve our project goals more efficiently. We'll be rolling out training

[01:08] sessions next week to help you familiarize yourselves with the new platform. We encourage
[01:13] you to attend. Thank you.
