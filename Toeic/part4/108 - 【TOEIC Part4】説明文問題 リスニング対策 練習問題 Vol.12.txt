[07:13] Good morning, everyone.

[07:14] Today, I will be discussing an important phase in our new product development process,
[07:19] prototyping and its evaluation.
[07:21] A prototype is the first step in embodying an idea and testing it in a form close to the actual

[07:27] product. It allows us to identify and correct design flaws or functional issues early on.
[07:33] This process is also crucial for accurately estimating the necessary resources.
[07:38] By understanding the resources required for creating a prototype, such as materials,

[07:43] time and personnel, we can manage the budget properly and contribute to the success of the
[07:48] project. Through repeated improvements of the prototype, we can deliver a higher quality
