[05:16] Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following speech.

[05:19] Okay, everyone, welcome to the Innovation Hub.
[05:22] Today, I want to briefly explain our new energy recovery system.
[05:26] This system is designed to capture wasted mechanical energy from industrial processes

[05:32] and convert it into usable electricity.
[05:34] Traditionally, this energy has been lost as heat or vibration,
[05:38] but our technology is not.

[05:40] We are not going to use it.
[05:42] This energy has been lost as heat or vibration,
[05:45] but our technology utilizes advanced piezoelectric materials

[05:49] and a unique mechanical linkage mechanism
[05:51] to efficiently convert even small amounts of kinetic energy.
[05:55] This not only improves energy efficiency,

[05:58] but also reduces operational costs and environmental impact.
[06:02] We've already implemented a pilot program in our manufacturing plant,
[06:06] and the results are very promising.

[06:08] We believe this technology has the potential to revolutionize energy management in various industries.

[07:36] Hello everyone, and thank you for gathering today.
[07:40] I'd like to introduce our newest team member, Mr. Kenji Sato.

[07:44] Mr. Sato brings a wealth of experience to our team.
[07:47] His academic background is in engineering, specifically in renewable energy systems,
[07:53] from Tokyo Institute of Technology.

[07:55] After graduating, he worked for seven years at GreenTech Solutions,
[07:59] where he was part of the R&D team.
[08:02] He came highly recommended for his ability to specialize in developing

[08:06] efficient solar panel technology.
[08:08] We are very excited to have him on board and look forward to his contributions.
