[07:15] recruit asterisk personnel with more diverse skills and experience.

[07:28] Furthermore, we will also focus on developing the abilities of our employees.

[07:56] operational efficiency.

[07:58] The new system will simplify business processes, allowing employees to focus on more strategic
[08:03] tasks.
[08:05] These changes are essential for our employees to perform their jobs more efficiently and

[08:09] improve the company's overall productivity.
[08:12] Finally, as we implement these changes, we may ask for your cooperation in many ways,
[08:17] and we appreciate your understanding and support.

[08:21] If you have any questions or concerns regarding the new system, please feel free to contact
[08:25] the Human Resources Department.
