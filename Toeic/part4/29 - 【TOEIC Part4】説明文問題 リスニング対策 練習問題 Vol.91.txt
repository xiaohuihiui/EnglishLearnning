[07:16] Questions 13 through 15 refer to the following speech.
[07:21] Good morning, listeners. This is Global Agriculture News. I'm your host, Sarah Chen.
[07:27] Today, we're discussing the future of food production. As the global population continues

[07:32] to grow, the demand for food is increasing exponentially. This puts immense pressure
[07:38] on agricultural systems to produce more with less. Traditionally, the use of synthetic fertilizer
[07:44] has been a key component in significantly boosting crop yields worldwide. However, concerns about

[07:51] environmental impact and sustainability have led to a significant shift. Researchers are now
[07:56] focusing on sustainable farming methods and smart farming technologies, such as precision
[08:02] agriculture, which optimizes the use of resources, including natural fertilizers,

[08:07] to maximize output while minimizing waste. This new approach is crucial for feeding a
[08:13] growing world without depleting our natural resources and ensures a healthier planet for
[08:17] future generations. Thank you for listening.
