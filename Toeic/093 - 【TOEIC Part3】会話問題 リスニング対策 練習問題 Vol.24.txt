Questions 277 through 279 refer to the following conversation.
Adeline, I've been reviewing the progress on the new marketing campaign, and I'm noticing some areas where we might need more hands on involvement.
Okay, Axel, could you specify which areas you're referring to?
Certainly, firstly, the data analysis phase seems to be moving slower than anticipated.
I think we need to take a more proactive approach there.
Secondly, we seem to be struggling to coordinate with the advertising agency.
Communication appears to be delayed, which is slowing things down.
I see, I agree about the data analysis.
Perhaps I could assign an extra resource to work on it.
As for the agency, I'll reach out to our contact person there and try to establish a better communication plan.
That sounds like a good plan, Adeline.
Let's meet again tomorrow to discuss the changes you've made.
Sounds good, Axel, I'll prepare some updates for our meeting tomorrow.
