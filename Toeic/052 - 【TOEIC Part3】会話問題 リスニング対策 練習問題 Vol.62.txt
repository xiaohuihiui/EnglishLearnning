Questions four through six refer to the following conversation.
Hello, this is Oliver calling from Tech Solutions Support Center. How may I help you today?
Hi Oliver, this is Lillian. I'm having trouble accessing my account online. It keeps saying unauthorized access.
Okay, Lillian, let me look into that for you. Can you please provide me with your account number and date of birth?
Sure, it's a C12,345 and my date of birth is June 15, 1988.
Thank you, just one moment. Okay, I see the problem. It looks like your account has been temporarily logged due to several failed login attempts.
Oh, I see. I probably tried logging in too many times with the wrong password.
That's likely the case. I can unlock it for you. However, I need to verify your identity first. Can you confirm the name of the physician you last visited?
Let me think it was Dr. Emily Carter.
Thank you. Just one more question. What is the last four digits of your social security number?
It's 6,789.
Perfect. Thank you for your cooperation. I have now authorized your account for access. Please try logging in again.
You may want to reset your password. Great. Thank you so much, Oliver. I appreciate your help.
You're welcome, Lillian. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
No, that's all. Thanks again.

Hi, Caroline. Thanks for coming in today. Let's start by talking about your experience with software development.
