Question 1 through 3, refer to the following conversation.
Hey Skyler, are you still looking for a new apartment?
Yeah, Ethan, it's been such a hassle.
I've seen so many, but none of them feel right.
I know the feeling, what are your absolute must-haves?
Well, it needs to be pet friendly.
I can't leave Mr. Fluffers behind, and a balcony would be great.
What about you? Did you ever move?
No, still in the same place.
But I've been thinking about redecorating.
I'm trying to figure out my design preference.
Oh, that sounds fun.
Maybe we can swap ideas sometime.
But first, I need to find this apartment.

Hello, this is Noah from Tech Solutions Support.
How can I help you today?
Hi, this is Victoria.
I'm having trouble setting up the printer I bought last week.
Okay, could you please provide the model number of the printer?
Yes, the model number is XP450.
Thank you, XP450.
Beforehand, did you read the installation guide?
Yes, I did.
However, I'm stuck at the second phase, connecting to the Wi-Fi.
I see you're having trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi.
Is the printer close to the router?
Yes, they are in the same room.
Okay, let's try resetting the printer's Wi-Fi settings.
Please turn it off and on again, and then select Wi-Fi reset from the settings menu.

Kinsley, good morning.
How did the marketing meeting go this morning?
Good morning, Joseph.
Yes, it went quite well.
We finalized the plan for the launch campaign of the new product.
Great, what are the specific details?
Well, we plan to significantly increase advertising on social media.
And we'll also focus on influencer marketing.
I see, that will be a tailwind for the sales team.
By the way, what about pricing?
We decided to set the price slightly higher than our competitors.
However, we are planning a discount campaign for early adopters.
Interesting, discounts for early adopters are important.
It can attract customer interest.
Yes, that's what I think.
Surprisingly, sales of similar products from our competitors are also strong.
So, we think we can succeed even with an aggressive pricing strategy.
Understood, can you show me the entire campaign blueprint?
I want to share it with the sales team.
Of course, I'll send it to you by email later.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Good morning, Miss Sadie.
Thank you for coming in today.
I'm Aiden, and I'll be assisting you with your travel plans.
Good morning, Aiden.
I'm planning a trip to Europe, but I'm feeling overwhelmed with all the options.
I understand, to start, have you considered joining one of our guided tours?
We have several options covering different regions and interests.
I had a look online.
I'm a bit concerned about a data leak I read about, though.
Is our personal information safe?
That's a valid concern.
We've since implemented stricter security protocols.
We also offer travel insurance that covers identity theft protection as well.
Would you be interested in learning more about this?
That's reassuring to hear.
Tell me about the orientation session for the European tour.
What exactly does it cover?
The orientation covers everything from packing tips and cultural etiquette to health and safety information.
It's designed to prepare you for a smooth and enjoyable trip.
That sounds very helpful.
I think I'd like to sign up for the orientation and explore the guided tour options further.
