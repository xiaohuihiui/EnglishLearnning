Question 1-3, refer to the following conversation Hi Naomi, this is Anthony from Stellar Tech.
I'm calling to follow up on our recent meeting about the software upgrade.
Hi Anthony, thanks for calling.
Yes, I've been reviewing the proposal.
I appreciate you being so considerate with the tailored features.
You're welcome.
We aim to provide solutions that best fit our clients' needs.
Are there any specific areas you have questions about?
Actually, there is one.
I noticed that the initial cost estimate is a little higher than I was expecting.
Is there any flexibility there?
I understand, let me see, we could potentially adjust the timeline of the implementation.
Also, we may have a surplus of licenses from our previous client contract
and using these could reduce your upfront costs.
Would that be helpful?
That would be great.
Please let me know the adjusted proposal.
Thanks for your flexibility, Anthony.
Certainly, Naomi, I'll get that over to you by the end of the day.
Thanks for your time.

Questions 4-6 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a tourist here.
I was wondering if you could recommend a good local restaurant.
Oh, sure, well, it depends on what kind of cuisine you're in the mood for.
We have a lot of options.
I'm open to anything authentic and local.
Something that would give me a significant taste of the city.
In that case, I would recommend the old town eatery.
It's a bit hidden but serves traditional dishes that locals love.
Their seafood stew is particularly popular.
That sounds perfect. Is it far from here?
It's about a 15-minute walk or you could take a short bus ride.
I can show you on the map if you like.
That would be very helpful. Thank you so much.

Question 7 through 9 referred to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost.
I'm trying to find the local farmer's market.
I heard it has a great selection of fresh crop.
Oh, the farmer's market?
It's usually held on Saturdays, but this week it's been moved due to the annual harvest festival.
It's now at the park on Elm Street.
The park on Elm Street got it. Do you know how far it is from here?
It's about a 15-minute walk.
If you walk this way and take a left at the end of the street, you should get there promptly.
That's very helpful. Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.
No problem at all.
Enjoy your visit to the market.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm Charles, a tourist.
I'm having some trouble finding the local market.
Could you help me?
Oh, hello Charles.
I'm Grace.
Sure, I can help.
The market is a bit hidden.
It's not on the main street.
What kind of things are you hoping to find there?
I'm looking for some local crafts and foods.
I'd also like to learn a bit more about the culture here.
Okay, the market is a good place for that.
Actually, I saw some interesting stalls there this morning.
The items are well made, and they have a lot of content about the local history.
I even bought some spices myself.
That sounds great.
I'm excited to visit.
By the way, is there anything else I should know about the market before I go?
Well, it can get very crowded, especially in the afternoon.
Also, some vendors might try to overcharge tourists,
so it's good to investigate the prices a bit beforehand.
Thank you so much for the tips, Grace.
That's very helpful.
No problem, Charles, enjoy your visit.
