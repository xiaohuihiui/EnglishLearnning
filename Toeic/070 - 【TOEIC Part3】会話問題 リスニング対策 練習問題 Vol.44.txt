Hi is Abella, this is Caleb. I'm calling about the recent maintenance on your company's servers.
Hi Caleb, thanks for calling. How did it go?
Everything went smoothly. I just wanted to let you know that the server is now operating optimally.
We also set it up to send you performance reports periodically.
That's great news. Will these reports be sent via mail?
Yes, they will be sent to the email address we have on file.
Let me know if you'd like to change that. Also, is there anything else I can help you with today?
No, I think that's everything. Thanks for the update, Caleb.

Hello, I'm looking over the sales figures for this quarter and the
outlook isn't as positive as we'd hoped. I agree, Charles, I was reviewing them as well.
It seems the new marketing campaign hasn't had the impact we were expecting.
Yes, perhaps we need to reassess our strategy. Also, I wanted to ask about the office space we
discussed last week. Is it still available? Yes, it is. It's fully furnished and ready for immediate
occupancy. I have a few other potential clients interested, though, so we should act quickly.
Okay, that's good to know. I think a physical meeting to discuss both issues further is in order.
Can we schedule something for early next week? Certainly, Charles, let me check my schedule and
I'll get back to you with some options.

Questions 7 through 9 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Quinn, this is Elijah from Tech Solutions. I'm calling about the smart refrigerator you installed last week.
Oh, hi Elijah. Yes, I was hoping someone would call. It seems to be having some issues
with the inventory tracking. I see. Could you describe the problem? Is it not recognizing
items you've been in? Exactly, for example, I went to the grocery store and bought several items,
but the refrigerator only registered half of them. Okay, that's definitely not how it's
supposed to work. Have you tried restarting the unit? Yes, I did that yesterday, but it didn't fix the
issue. Also, the temperature display seems a little off too. It's showing as much warmer than it
actually is. Okay, this sounds more serious than I initially thought. It could be a faulty sensor.
I would like to send a technician out to take a look at it. That would be great. When can they come?
I can arrange for someone to come tomorrow morning. We do want to express caution to not store
anything temperature sensitive until the issue is resolved. Okay, I understand. Thank you so much for
your help, Elijah. Hi Quinn. This is Elijah from Tech Solutions. I'm calling about the

Aubrey, thanks for coming in. I wanted to talk about the performance review process for this year.
Okay, William, I'm ready. Is there anything specific you wanted to discuss?
Yes, I've been reviewing the existing process and I think there are a few areas we can improve
to make it more effective and less time consuming for everyone. That sounds good. I felt like the
current system is a bit clunky, especially the self-review portion. Exactly, I was thinking we could
simplify the self-review form and provide more specific examples of what we are looking for.
Also, I want to streamline the manager's review section. That would be very helpful.
I know many of us struggle to articulate our achievements effectively in the current format.
Great, I am going to draft the new review process and share it with you for your feedback.
It will be ready by next week. Sounds perfect, William. I look forward to seeing it.
