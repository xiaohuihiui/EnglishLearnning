Arya, I wanted to discuss your recent performance review. While your technical skills are impressive, there's a noticeable lack of teamwork in your recent projects.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Aila, I wanted to talk about the recent project delay. I know it's been a bit stressful for everyone.
Yes, Anthony. It has been quite challenging. I think a clearer project directory might have helped us stay on track better.
I agree. I've been reviewing our current documentation in your ride. We need a more organized directory. I'm thinking of creating a new one with more specific folders. What do you think?
Sounds like a great idea. It would definitely help everyone navigate the project materials more efficiently and avoid future delays.
Perhaps we could also have a quick training session on how to use it.
Excellent point, Aila. Let's get that organized this week. Thanks for your input.
