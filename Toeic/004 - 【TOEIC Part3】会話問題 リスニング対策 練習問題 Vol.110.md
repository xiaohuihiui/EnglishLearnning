Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, Carson. I've been enjoying my stay here, but I have a couple of suggestions that I believe
could really enhance the guest experience. Of course, Miss Harper. We always appreciate guest feedback.
Please tell me what's on your mind. Well, for instance, I found the business center a bit lacking in
advanced photo editing options. I took some amazing pictures during my trip, and I was hoping to
print them, but I needed to crop some parts to get the perfect composition. It would be great if
there were more comprehensive tools available. I understand completely, we do have some basic software,
but I agree that advanced features could be beneficial. For your current need, I can personally assist
you, our main concierge desk has professional grade software and a high quality printer.
I can help you crop your photos and get them printed beautifully. Oh, that would be wonderful, Carson.
Thank you so much. I'd really appreciate your help. My pleasure, Miss Harper. If you could give
me your room number, I can meet you at the Concierge desk in about 10 minutes or whenever you're ready.
