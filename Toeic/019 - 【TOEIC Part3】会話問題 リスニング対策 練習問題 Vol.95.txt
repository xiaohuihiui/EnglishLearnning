Hi, Madison. Thanks for coming. Do you have any questions about the upcoming tech workshop?
Yes, Elijah. I'm curious about what kind of content will be covered. Will it be very technical?

We will just talk theory.
That sounds great. I'm a bit worried about grasping new concepts quickly.

Exactly. It's for anyone looking to gain hands on experience and understand how to leverage new tools in their work.
We believe in providing real value.
