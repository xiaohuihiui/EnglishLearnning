Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Ayla, I wanted to inform you about the new travel expense policy.
We've made some significant changes.
Oh, really? What are the main differences?
I usually just submit my receipts through the old system.
Well, now there's an array of new categories for expenses,
and we require pre-approval for anything over $500.
You'll need to use the new online portal for all submissions.
I see. So, no more paper forms for anything?
And is there a deadline to start using the new system?
That's right, all digital.
And yes, the new system is mandatory starting next Monday.
Please review the detailed guidelines on the intranet.

Welcome, Aria.
So glad you could make it to the new student orientation.
We've put a lot of effort into making this event beneficial for everyone.
Hi, Christopher. I'm really glad to be here.
I've heard great things about these orientations and was looking forward to it.
That's wonderful to hear.
We always strive to maintain a high standard for our welcoming events.
Today, you'll get to meet various faculty members
and learn about the resources available to you.
That's exactly what I'm hoping for.
I'm particularly interested in the professors from the science and humanities faculty.
Will there be representatives from those departments?
Yes, absolutely.
We have key professors from both the science faculty
and the humanities faculty presenting later this morning.
They'll be sharing information about their programs and research opportunities.
Perfect. I'm looking forward to it.
It sounds like you've really set a high standard for this year's orientation.

Questions seven through nine refer to the following conversation.
Bella, thanks for coming in.
I wanted to discuss your annual health checkup status.
Of course, Josiah. I actually have a question about it.
Go ahead.
Well, I was wondering if the new health plan covers video conferencing.
Yes, of course, Josiah.
I actually have a question about it.
Go ahead.
Well, I was wondering if the new health plan covers video conferencing.
Yes, of course.
Well, I was wondering if the new health plan covers visits
to a specific type of specialist like a nutritionist.
My friend mentioned their company's plan does.
That's a good question.
Our standard plan covers general practitioners and most specialists.
But for specific alternative therapies or dietitians, it varies.
However, we are currently negotiating with providers to expand coverage in those areas.
For now, you would need a referral from your primary physician to ensure it's covered.
I see. So, I should first consult my general doctor?
Exactly. And regarding the annual checkup,
we'd like all employees to complete it by the end of next month.
We've sent out reminders.
Oh, I received it. I'll make sure to schedule mine soon.
Thank you for clarifying about the nutritionist, Josiah.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Hey, Kinsley, did you get the email about the annual company retreat?
Yes, I just read it.
It looks like there's been a change regarding the venue.
Oh, really? I haven't had a chance to check my inbox yet. What's new?
They've moved it from the Grand Hotel to the Lakeside Convention Center.
Apparently, the Grand Hotel had a double booking.
That's a significant change.
Is it still the same?
Yes, the fee remains the same. However, the email also mentioned that if you can't attend due to
this change, you can request a full refund by the end of next week.
That's good to know. I was looking forward to the Grand Hotel,
but the Lakeside Convention Center isn't bad either. I just need to confirm my availability.
Make sure to do it soon. The deadline is on the day of the retreat.
