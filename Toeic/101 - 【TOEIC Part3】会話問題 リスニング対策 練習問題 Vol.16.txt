We're evaluating a few different server models.
I have a proposal with estimated costs and performance improvements prepared.
Shall we go over it?
Yes, that would be great. Let's proceed.

Excuse me, I'm a bit lost.
Could you tell me how to get to the city museum?
Sure, it's not too far from here.
Walk straight down this street for about two blocks, then turn left.
You'll see it on your right. It's right next to the park.
Okay, two blocks straight and then left.
Got it. By the way, I was reading that this area has seen a large increase in tourism recently.
Is that true?
Yes, absolutely.
It has become very popular, especially since the new walking tours were introduced.
We are seeing a large influx of people and the subsequent challenges keeping up with the demand.
That's interesting. Well, thank you so much for the directions.
You're welcome. Enjoy your visit.

Hi Brooklyn, I'm calling to follow up on the shipment of the new product line.
We were expecting them last week.
Hi Levi, thanks for calling. I apologize for the delay.
There seems to have been an issue at the manufacturer's facility.
Oh, really? What happened?
Apparently, there was a malfunction with one of the machines and it caused a slight hold up in production.
We didn't do this intentionally, of course.
I understand, when can we expect the delivery now?
The manufacturer assures me that the goods will be ready to ship by the end of this week.
I'll send you a confirmation once they're dispatched.
Okay, thank you for the update, Brooklyn. I appreciate it.
