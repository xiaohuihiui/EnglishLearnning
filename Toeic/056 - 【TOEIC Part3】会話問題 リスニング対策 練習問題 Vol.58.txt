Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Samantha, I wanted to inform you about the upcoming changes to our delivery schedule.
Oh, hi John, thanks for letting me know.
What kind of changes are we talking about?
We've had some internal discussions and decided to consolidate our routes.
This means that your deliveries might arrive a bit earlier or later than before.
Okay, that's good to know.
Will this affect all inter-office deliveries or just certain areas?
It'll affect all inter-office deliveries for now, but we will try to minimize the impact as much as possible.
We'll be sending an official email with the exact changes later today.
That sounds great.
I appreciate the early notice, John.
This will help us adjust internally.
Thank you.

Questions 4-6 refer to the following conversation.
Anna, I need to talk to you about the following week's project schedule.
Okay, William, what's the matter?
I've just received news that some key resources will be unavailable.
We need to reschedule the tasks for the first two days of the week.
Oh, that's not good.
What should we do instead?
I was thinking we could shift everything by two days, starting the tasks on Wednesday instead.
Does that sound feasible to you?
Yes, I think that's doable.
I'll make the necessary adjustments to our timeline and inform the team.
Great, let me know if you face any issues.
Thanks, Anna.

Question 7 through 9 referred to the following conversation.
Ellinore, can we talk about the new expense report procedure?
Sure.
Is there something you're unsure about?
I'm a bit confused about the administrative steps for submitting receipts.
It seems a little complicated.
Okay, let me explain it more clearly.
First, you need to scan all your receipts, then upload them to the system, and fill out the online form.
Do you follow?
I see. So, no more paper copies? That's a big change.
That's right. It's all digital now to streamline the administrative process.
It should also be faster once you get the hang of it.
