Good morning, where can I take you today?
Good morning, Aaron. I need to get to the airport.
Terminal 3, please.
My flight departs in about an hour and a half, so I'm quite pressed for time.
Terminal 3, understood. At this hour, traffic can be a bit challenging.
I'll take the back roads to avoid the main highway congestion.
This should ensure a timely arrival, ideally within 45 minutes, giving you plenty of time before boarding.
Oh, that's excellent. I appreciate you planning the quickest route.
By the way, would it be possible to make a very quick stop at the bank near the airport?
It would literally take just two minutes to use the ITM.
Come, a quick stop at the bank. It really depends on its exact location relative to our optimized route.
If it's directly on our way and doesn't significantly add to the travel time, then we can consider it.
We need to mutually agree that it won't jeopardize your flight schedule.
Of course, I understand. If it's too much of a detour or risks my flight, then let's just head straight to the airport.
My flight is definitely the priority.
All right. I'll check the map for the bank's precise location and it's impact on the route.
Either way, I'll make sure you get to Terminal 3 efficiently and stress free.

Question 4 through 6, refer to the following conversation.
Good morning, Mia.
I prepared a few options for the South American trip we discussed previously.
Good morning, Lincoln. Thank you. What kind of options do you have?
Firstly, I'd like to initiate a plan that combines hiking the Inca trail in Peru with an Amazon jungle adventure.
That sounds interesting. Could you tell me about the specific dates and costs?
Certainly, this plan is for 10 days and all accommodations are in eco-friendly lodges.
The cost, including airfare, is approximately $3,000.
$3,000, I was hoping to keep the budget a bit lower. Do you have any other suggestions?
Understood. I also have a plan focusing on an eco-tour in Costa Rica.
This one is shorter and more budget-friendly.
That sounds great. Could you elaborate on the Costa Rica plan?
The Costa Rica plan is for seven days, mainly focusing on wildlife observation in national parks and coffee farm visits.
The estimated cost is around $2,000.
$2,000 fits my budget and wildlife observation sounds appealing.
What about meals and transportation?
Meals will be centered around local organic food and heal a range of private minivan for transportation.
A local guide will also accompany you for your peace of mind.
That's superb. Please go ahead with the Costa Rica plan.

Excuse me, could you offer some assistance? I'm a bit lost.
Of course, what can I help you with? Where are you trying to go?
I'm looking for the national museum. Is it far from here?
Not too far. You can take the subway. The station is just around the corner.
Oh, that's great. Do you know if there are any delays on the subway line right now?
I need to know it's current status.
Hum, I haven't heard of any. It's usually quite punctual, but you can check the display board at the station entrance for the latest updates.
Thank you so much for your help. You've been a great assistance.
You're welcome. Enjoy the museum.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Hi, Autumn. Thanks for reaching out about the upcoming future innovation summit.
I wanted to give you an update on the preparations. We've been quite busy with the venue as there's still some construction going on, but it's nearing completion.
Oh, that's good to hear, Eastern. I was actually wondering about the venue's readiness.
And how are things progressing with the administrative side of the registration?
I want to make sure I've completed all the necessary steps.
The administrative process for registrations is largely on track. We've received a great number of participants.
We just have a few more administrative checks to finalize before we can send out the final confirmation details.
Rest assured if anything is missing, we'll notify you individually.
That's a relief, so regarding the construction, will all areas be accessible by the event date?
I'm particularly interested in the breakout session rooms.
Yes, the main halls and all scheduled session rooms, including breakout areas, will be fully accessible.
The construction primarily involves some external landscaping and a new facade, which won't impact internal access or the event flow.
