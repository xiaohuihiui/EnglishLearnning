Hi Ruby, thanks for coming in. I wanted to chat about your performance lately.
Hi Caden, no problem. I'm happy to discuss it. Is there anything specific you're concerned about?
Well, I've noticed you seem a bit less engaged in team meetings.
Also, your project deadlines have been slipping a little.
I apologize for that. I've been dealing with some personal issues that have made it difficult to focus.
I know that's not an excuse.
I understand, Ruby, it happens, however, we need to adapt to changes and maintain productivity.
Perhaps we could adjust your workload temporarily to help you manage things better?
That would be very helpful, Caden. I really appreciate that. I'm committed to getting back on track.
Great, let's work together on this. We'll schedule a follow-up next week to see how things are progressing.

Question 7 through 9 refer to the following conversation.
Isla, have you looked into the sales figures for the model X this quarter?
Yes, Anthony.
It seems sales have been significantly lower than projected.
I think it's because the model Y was released.
It's impacting the sales of the model X.
That's what I feared.
We might need to consider some adjustments.
Have you analyzed the sales data of model X overseas?
Yes, I have.
It's similar trend in most of over-see markets.
Actually, some retailers are asking us to discontinue model X because of poor sales.
That's concerning.
We need to discuss this with the product development team.
Let's schedule a meeting for tomorrow.
