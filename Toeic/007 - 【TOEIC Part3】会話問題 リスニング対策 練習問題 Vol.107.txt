Question 4 through 6, refer to the following conversation.
Madison, thanks for coming.
I wanted to show you the latest iteration of our new product, the quantum leap device.
Oh, excellent. What improvements have you made since the last prototype?
Our clients are eagerly waiting for updates.
We've enhanced the battery life significantly and also streamlined the user interface.
However, the connectivity feature we discussed is still in a temporary testing phase.
We expect to finalize it next month.
That's good to hear about the battery.
Regarding the connectivity, some clients mentioned they'd like to see seamless integration with existing smart home systems.
Will you be able to incorporate that feedback into the final design?
Absolutely, that's precisely what we're working on.
We plan to incorporate a universal API to allow for broader compatibility.
Your feedback is invaluable.
Fantastic. I'll relay this information to our key accounts.
When can we expect a demo unit with all these features finalize?
We're aiming for a fully functional demo unit by the end of the next quarter.

Question 7 through 9 refer to the following conversation.
Zoe, I have a few questions regarding last week's project report.
Specifically, about the cost effectiveness aspect.
Certainly, William, go ahead. I'm ready to answer your questions.
The report indicates that the marketing expenses seem to exceed the initial budget slightly.
Could you elaborate on the reason for that?
Yes, I can explain that. We increased our investment in a new online advertising platform.
While this pushed up the initial costs, it significantly expanded our market reach,
and we project the ROI.
Return on investment will exceed expectations as a result.
I see, that makes sense, and would you say the overall performance of this project is comparable to previous projects of a similar scale?
Yes, precisely, despite the minor budget overrun, in terms of key deliverables and market impact,
we are seeing progress that is entirely comparable to, if not better than, our previous successful projects.
Customer engagement metrics are also exceptionally strong.
That's reassuring to hear. Thank you for the detailed explanation. Zoe, I'll review these figures further,
and we can discuss them in our next meeting.
