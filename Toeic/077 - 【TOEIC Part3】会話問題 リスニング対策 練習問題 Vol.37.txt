Hi, Ila. Thanks for coming in today. We're excited to learn more about your
background. Thanks, Owen. I'm happy to be here. So we had planned to discuss your project
management experience in detail today. However, due to an unexpected scheduling conflict,
our team conference has been moved to this afternoon. We may have to post-pone our discussion
a bit. Oh, I see. That's understandable. I'm flexible. Great. How about we continue after
the conference, say around 3 p.m. Does that work for you? Yes, 3 p.m. works perfectly. Thank

Hello, Charlotte. Thank you for coming in today. I'm Jayce, the hiring manager. Please
have a seat. Thank you, Jayce. It's nice to meet you too. So, looking at your resume, I'm impressed
with your experience. Can you tell me more about a time when you had to be particularly dependable?
Certainly, in my previous role, there was a major system failure right before a critical deadline.
I worked around the clock with my team to resolve it, ensuring that we met the deadline.
My colleagues always considered me dependable because they could rely on me to be there during hard times
and get things done. That's great to hear. This role requires a dependable person because we rely
heavily on our team's work. Could you elaborate on your technical skills that would help to establish a
great connection with our tech team? Of course, I have a strong background in software development
and project management, which allows me to quickly understand technical issues and effectively
communicate with technical teams. That sounds excellent. Do you have any questions for me? Yes,
I do. I'd like to know more about the team culture and opportunities for professional development.

Question 7 through 9 referred to the following conversation.
Lucy, I'm keenly interested in the feedback from our last product demonstration.
How did the client respond? Josiah, it was quite positive overall. They were especially
impressed with the new software integration. However, they had some questions about the subsequent
maintenance costs. Okay, that's helpful. I should prepare a detailed cost breakdown to address
their concerns before our next meeting. That would be great. I think that information is key to
securing the deal. Lucy, I'm keenly interested in the feedback from our last product demonstration.

new software system we discussed at our last meeting. Hi, Logan. Yes, I remember. What can I do for
you today? Well, our development team has made some significant progress. I wanted to give you an update

Also, we've heard your feedback on the user interface, so we've made some enhancements to make it
more intuitive. We are trying to pursue what's the best for you. That's excellent news. I appreciate
