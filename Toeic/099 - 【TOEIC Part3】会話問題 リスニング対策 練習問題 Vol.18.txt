Questions 205 through 207 refer to the following conversation Hi Piper, thanks for coming in today.
Hi Aaron, nice to meet you. I'm Piper and I'm looking to upgrade our current server system.
I understand, what are some of the key challenges you're facing with your current setup?
Well, our data storage is becoming insufficient and we've been experiencing slower processing speeds.
Also, I'm concerned about the current system's vulnerability. It does not effectively expose potential security flaws and it's proving difficult to manage.
I see, that's a common issue. We've got some solutions that could address those concerns.
Our new cloud-based server system can handle large amounts of data and has much faster processing speeds.
It also has advanced security features and is designed to be easier to manage.
That sounds promising, how long would it take for us to acquire an implement this new system?
We estimate the implementation period to be around three to four weeks, depending on the data transfer and any customization you might need.
We'll work with you every step of the way.

Question's 210, refer to the following conversation.
Hi Ivy, do you have a minute? I wanted to discuss the upcoming training session for the new software.
Sure, Wesley, what's on your mind?
Well, I'm a bit concerned about the resource allocation. We seem to be short on instructors and the training materials.
I understand, the initial turnout for the training was higher than expected. We may need to adjust our schedule or find additional resources.
Exactly, perhaps we can also look into utilizing online modules for some parts of the training to reduce the need for physical instructors and materials.
What do you think?
That's a great idea. It could also be more flexible for those with busy schedules. Let's look into that option and also check if any other departments can lend us any extra resources.
