Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Maya, I'm Parker. Thanks for coming in today.
I understand you're having some issues with the new software?
Yes, Parker, it's the voting system.
It doesn't seem to be working properly for the upcoming mayor election.
Okay, can you explain what's exactly going wrong?
Well, when I try to enter a vote for a candidate, it sometimes doesn't register.
Also, the reporting feature is giving me an accurate data.
I see, that's definitely not good, especially with a major election coming up.
We'll need to fix this quickly. Let me take a look at it.
Thank you. I'm really counting on you to fix this before the voting process starts.

Questions four through six refer to the following conversation.
Hi Audrey, thanks for coming in today. I'm Grayson and I'll be interviewing you.
It's a pleasure to be here, Grayson. Thank you for having me.
So, looking at your resume, I see you have extensive experience in project management.
Could you tell me about a particularly challenging project you've handled?
Certainly, in my previous role, I let a team that was tasked with implementing a new software system.
It was challenging due to a tight deadline and complex integration requirements,
but we successfully completed it by effectively prioritizing tasks.
That sounds impressive. Our company also has strict regulations concerning data privacy,
so it's crucial that everyone here understands and complies with them.
How familiar are you with these types of regulations?
I am very familiar with data privacy regulations. I've consistently ensured my team and projects
adhered to these regulations, always keeping up to date with the latest changes.

Question 7 through 9 referred to the following conversation.
Nora, I was reviewing the proposal for the team celebration. Have you made any progress on it?
Yes, Anthony, I've drafted a few options, considering the budget and the team's preferences.
I've also checked if the venues are feasible for our group size.
That's great. Could you tell me some details? I was also wondering about the timing if it's feasible to have it before the end of the month.
Of course, I was aiming for the last week of the month. The initial options are a dinner at the restaurant near our office or a team building game at the park.
The park option would be more affordable. I also included other options like doing something online in case we find that the dates and venue are not feasible for everyone.
That sounds comprehensive. Thanks Nora. Let's review the options together this afternoon. I am looking forward to having a celebration with everyone.
