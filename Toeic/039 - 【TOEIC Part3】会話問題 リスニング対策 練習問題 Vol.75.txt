Questions 1-3 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Elizabeth, thanks for meeting me. I wanted to discuss the upcoming company event preparations.
Hi Jayce, no problem. I'm glad we could find some time.
What's on your mind regarding the event?
Mainly about the venue setup. We plan to use the large conference room on the top floor, right?
We'll need to convert it into an event space, which will require some effort, especially with the technical equipment.
Yes, that's the plan. Our team is coordinating with the facilities department for the layout and furniture.
I know converting it will be a task, but I think it's worth it. The view from there is really scenic.
That's true. The scenic view will be a great plus for the attendees.
But we need to make sure the sound system and screens are properly installed for presentations and entertainment.
My team can help with the technical aspects, but we need a clear plan.
Agreed, let's schedule a joint meeting with the facilities and IT teams next week to finalize the setup plan and assign responsibilities.
I'll send out an invite shortly.

Hi Allison, I wanted to talk to you briefly about the new professional development program we're launching.
Oh, yes, Aiden, I saw an email about it yesterday. What's it about?
We've recently updated the job description for many roles, and this program is designed to help employees gain the skills needed to meet those new expectations.
That sounds important, what kind of skills will be covered?
We'll focus on advanced digital tools and collaborative project management techniques. There will be a series of training sessions throughout the next month.
A series of sessions, are these mandatory for everyone?
No, they are optional, but highly encouraged. The first session is scheduled for next Monday.
Okay, is there a detailed description of each session or the whole program available somewhere?
Yes, you can find a comprehensive description in the full schedule of all sessions on the HR internal portal.
Please check it out at your convenience.
Great, I will, thank you, Aiden.

Question 10 through 12, refer to the following conversation.
Hi, can you take me to the Central Library?
Certainly. The Central Library. Traffic might be a bit heavy this time of day.
Okay, that's fine. I'm not in a huge rush.
Good. I've been driving in this city for over a decade now. I've seen quite extensive development, especially downtown.
It's changed so much. Oh, really? I haven't been here in a few years. What's changed the most?
Well, there are many new buildings and the public transport system has been extensively updated.
But traffic is still a challenge. I see. It must be interesting to witness all that change from the driver's seat.
It is. You get an extensive view of how the city functions, the patterns of movement.
