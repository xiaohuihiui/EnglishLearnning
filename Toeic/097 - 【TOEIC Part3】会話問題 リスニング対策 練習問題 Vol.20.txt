Madeline, the new office space looks fantastic.
I especially love the mural in the reception area.
It really brightens up the room.
Thank you, Ezra. We wanted something that would make a statement.
We're also very pleased with how spacious everything feels.
It's a big improvement from our old, cramped office.
I agree. It definitely feels more professional and comfortable for both your employees and clients.
Did you have any specific artists in mind when choosing the mural?
Yes, we actually commissioned the local artist.
We thought it was important to support the community and feature some of their talent.
And the spacious layout of the office has helped us with productivity as well.
That's a great idea. It seems like you've thought of everything.
I'm sure this new environment will be beneficial for your business.
We hope so. Thank you for your feedback, Ezra.

Questions 235 through 237 refer to the following conversation.
Hi, Liliana. Thanks for coming in today. I wanted to go over the project timeline and
our current progress.
Hi, Jason. Of course. I'm eager to see how the preparation for the new software is coming
along.
Well, we've made good progress on the coding front, but we're a bit behind on the user interface
design. We need to make sure it aligns with your initial perspective. I see. That's good
to know. How can we speed that up?
We're considering bringing in an external UX designer to help us out. That would require
a little bit of an adjustment to our budget, but I think it's the most effective solution.
That sounds like a good plan. Let's discuss the specifics and move forward with it.

Questions 238 through 240 refer to the following conversation.
Hi, Hannah. I'm Anthony. Thanks for coming in today. I wanted to talk about the recent technical
issue with your software.
Hi, Anthony. Thanks for having me. Yes, the system has been acting up. We're eager to get
it resolved quickly.
Absolutely. We've identified the cause and it seems to be related to a recent update.
We're preparing a patch, but it will require a short service interruption.
Okay. That's understandable. When will this service interruption take place?
We are planning for it this Friday around 8 p.m. We expected to last for a couple of hours.
We will ensure that it will not interfere with your business hours.
That sounds all right. Also, while you are working on it, could you give us an update
on the license renewal for our software?
We received a notice and I would like to clarify a few points, especially about periodical
payments.
Of course, the notice is accurate. The agreement outlines the periodical payments are due
on a quarterly basis.
I will send you a breakdown shortly. Also, let me confirm the information regarding the
software ownership.
That's good to know. Thank you so much, Anthony.
No problem, Hannah. We're committed to providing you the best support.
