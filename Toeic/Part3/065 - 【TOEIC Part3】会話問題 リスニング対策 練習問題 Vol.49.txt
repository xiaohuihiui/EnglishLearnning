Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Amelia, this is Alexander from Tech Solutions.
I'm calling about the network issue you reported yesterday.
Hi Alexander, thanks for calling back.
Yes, the issue is still ongoing.
Our team can access the shared drive, which is really slowing us down.
I understand, our team is currently investigating the cause.
It seems to be related to the server update we performed last week.
We need to figure out what caused this conflict.
We are trying our best to maintain the stability of the system.
Okay, that's good to know.
How long do you estimate it will take to fix it?
We're aiming to have it resolved within the next couple of hours.
In the meantime, could you provide me with the details of what exactly each member is doing?
It will help us quickly find and represent the problem to the team working on it.
Yes, of course.
I'll send you a breakdown of that right away.
Thank you for your quick response, Alexander.

Question 4 through 6 referred to the following conversation.
Addison, I'm having some trouble with this data analysis.
The array of numbers is so large and I'm not sure where to start.
I understand, Aiden, it can be overwhelming.
Have you tried sorting the array first?
That might make it easier to identify any patterns.
That's a good idea. I hadn't thought of that.
Also, do we have any tools for visualizing the various data points?
Yes, the company provides software that can create various types of charts and graphs.
I can show you how to use it after this meeting.

And through nine, refer to the following conversation.
Hi Sophia, this is Charles from ABC Company.
I'm calling about the proposal we said you last week.
Hi Charles, yes, I remember. We've reviewed it and we've decided to reject it.
We're not going forward with your offer at this time.
Oh, I see. Could you perhaps tell me the reason?
Was there something in the proposal that didn't meet your requirements?
Yes, the primary reason is that your pricing is too high for our current budget.
We've received a more competitive offer from another vendor.
We will also send an official mail to you with details.
I understand, thank you for the feedback, Sophia.
We'll take that into consideration.
Please send the mail when you have a moment.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Ellie, have you had a chance to look at the latest financial report?
Yes, Azure, I did. The numbers look good overall, but I'm a bit concerned about the lack of detail in the expense section.
It's not very transparent.
I agree. I noticed that too. It's difficult to understand where exactly the money is going.
We need more breakdown for sure.
Exactly. And it's hard to assess the impact on our actual income without a clear picture of the costs.
We should probably address this in the next meeting.
Absolutely. I'll prepare some points to raise and suggest specific improvements in the reporting process.
Transparency is crucial.
Great, Azure. That sounds like a good plan.
Let's aim to make this more open and clear for everyone involved.
