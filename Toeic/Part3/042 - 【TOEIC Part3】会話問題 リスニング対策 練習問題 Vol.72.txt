Good morning, Madison. I'm calling about our recent order.
Number 7,890. We received it yesterday, but it was only a partial shipment.
Good morning, Mr. Joseph. Yes, I'm aware of that. I apologize for the incomplete delivery.
We had some unexpected issues at the warehouse.
Unexpected issues? This is affecting our production schedule. When can we expect the
rest of the order?
We are working to resolve it. The delay is primarily due to the main transit route being heavily
congested after a recent incident. This has slowed down our logistics significantly.
heavily congested, icy, so the remaining items are stuck in transit. That's correct. They
are on a truck that is currently held up due to the congestion. We estimate the remaining
partial delivery will arrive within the next two business days. I will personally track
the shipment and inform you as soon as I have a more precise delivery time.
Two business days is acceptable, but please make sure there are no further delays.
We are counting on those parts. I understand the urgency, Mr. Joseph. I will do everything
I can to expedite it and keep you fully informed.
