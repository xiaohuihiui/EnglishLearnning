Questions 253 through 255 refer to the following conversation Vivian, do you have a minute?
I'm having trouble understanding the new schedule for using the conference room.
Sure, Santiago, what's the problem?
They changed the process a bit, didn't they?
Yes, it seems so.
Now we are supposed to book the conference room regularly on the website, but the process
looks complicated to me.
I understand, the new system has some designated timeslots for each department, which are
different from before.
I can show you how to do it.
Oh, that would be great.
Thanks a lot.
Let's go to my desk.
I'll show you now.
