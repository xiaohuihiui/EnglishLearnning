Questions 220 through 222 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost. I'm looking for the local hiking trails, but the map is a bit confusing. Do you know where the entrance is?
Oh, hello. Yes, of course. It's just around the corner from here by the old stone building.
You'll see a small sign for the mountain view trail. Be careful, though. The path can be slippery, especially after rain.
Do you have the right equipment? Yes, I think so. I've got good hiking boots, but thanks for the warning.
And is there anywhere to rent some better property or a first aid kit nearby, just in case?
Hum, there's a shop a few blocks away that rents out hiking gear, but I'm not sure about first aid kits. You're better off having your own. It's best to be prepared when going into nature.
Okay, I'll check that out. Thanks so much for the help. I appreciate it.
No problem. Enjoy the hike and be careful.

Question's 223 through 225 referred to the following conversation.
Hi, Clara. I'm Leo. I'm calling about the installation of the new system. Is everything on schedule?
Hello, thanks for calling. Actually, we've encountered a slide delay due to an unexpected issue with the network configuration.
Oh, I see. How much of a delay are we talking about?
We estimate it will be about two days. I'm very sorry about this. It's also going to slightly affect our tour schedule for your team.
That's unfortunate. Can we reschedule the tour to a later time then?
Yes, absolutely. Let's look at the calendar and find a time that works for everyone after the installation. I'll send you some options soon.

the following conversation Josephine I've reviewed your performance this quarter and
I wanted to commend you on your work on the recent marketing campaign.
Thank you Oliver. I'm glad to hear that. I put a lot of effort into it.
Your creativity really shown through. However, I do have a suggestion about your direct
communication with the design team. There were a few instances where there was some
miscommunication. Oh, I see. Can you provide me with some specific examples?
Certainly, for instance, the changes to the banner ad were made without clear instructions,
and it led to some confusion. We should aim for more clarity when giving feedback.
Okay, I understand. I'll make sure to be more direct and clear in the future.
