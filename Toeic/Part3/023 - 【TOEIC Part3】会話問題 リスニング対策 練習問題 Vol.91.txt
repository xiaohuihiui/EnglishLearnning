Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Labely, our inventory management system has been experiencing frequent unexpected errors.
Could you advise us on this issue?
That's troublesome.
What kind of errors are they?
Specifically, our engineers are very experienced in resolving these kinds of system issues.
The system often freezes during data entry and sometimes crashes completely.
This interrupts our work and hinders operations.

First, we need to thoroughly analyze the system logs to identify the root cause of the problem.
Based on that, we'll create the optimal fix or upgrade prescription for your company.
That's reassuring.
When can you start analyzing the logs?
We can start as early as tomorrow.
The analysis usually takes a few days, but I'll keep you updated on our progress.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Lily, I need some advice. I'm struggling with organizing documents for the new project and coordinating with other departments.
Oh, Wyatt. Well, regarding the documents, there are a few empty compartments in that large cabinet over there.
It's efficient to sort and store them by project.
I see. Thank you. But for interdepartmental coordination, it's hard to get our requests through.
How can I effectively negotiate?
Him. First, it's important to understand the other departments' priorities.
Try to explain clearly how our proposal benefits them from their perspective.
If necessary, it might be good to schedule a face-to-face meeting.
Many things are hard to convey just through email.
I hadn't thought about talking in person. I'll try that. Thank you very much.
