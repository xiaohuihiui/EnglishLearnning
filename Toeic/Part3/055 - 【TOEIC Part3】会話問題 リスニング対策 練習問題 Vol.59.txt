Question 1 through 3, refer to the following conversation.
Olivia, I'm looking at the system logs, and it seems like we're still having trouble with the server performance.
Especially with the increased traffic today.
Yes, Eastern, I noticed that too, it's slowing down our website quite a bit.
I think we might be understaffed to handle this kind of workload.
That's what I was afraid of. I've also noticed some packet loss.
It's affecting the data transmission.
We need to address this before it impacts our user's experience.
Agreed, I'll put together a proposal for hiring additional server technicians,
and perhaps we can investigate upgrading our network hardware to reduce the packet loss issue.
How does that sound?
That sounds like a good plan, Olivia.
Let's get started on those steps right away.

Questions 4-6 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost.
I'm trying to find the local market, but I can't seem to find the way.
Oh, the local market?
It's a bit hidden. You need to go straight down this road, then turn left at the big oak tree.
You'll see it right away.
By the way, have you tried our local produce yet?
We have a fantastic crop of mangoes this season.
That sounds great. I'm excited to try some.
I heard this area is known for its delicious fruits.
Do you have any recommendations?
Absolutely. The mangoes are a must, of course.
And we also have amazing pineapples and passion fruit.
Just be mindful of the local traffic rules, though.
They strictly enforce the no parking zones, especially on market days.
Thank you so much for the advice. I'll definitely remember that.
I'm looking forward to exploring the market and trying the local fruits.

Question 10 through 12, refer to the following conversation.
Hi, Avery. I'm Kai. Thanks for meeting with me.
I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to this new software.
I was hoping you could give me some guidance.
Hi Kai, it's nice to meet you too.
Of course, I'm happy to help.
I'm the vendor for this software, so I'm quite familiar with it.
What are you having trouble with?
Well, I'm trying to import the customer data, but it keeps giving me an error message.
I've tried everything I can think of.
Okay, that's a common issue.
It usually happens when the file format is incorrect.
Have you checked if the file is a CSV file?
Ah, no. I hadn't thought of that.
Let me check. You're right. It's a text file.
That makes sense now. Thanks so much.
No problem. Kai.
Glad I could help. Feel free to reach out if you run into any other problems.
