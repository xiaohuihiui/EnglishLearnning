Question 1 through 3, refer to the following conversation.
Hi Nora, do you have a moment? I need to discuss something important regarding the upcoming company anniversary event.
Sure, ever it, what's on your mind?
We absolutely need to import all the guest registration data from the old system to the new one.
It's essential for finalizing the seating arrangements and name badges, and the deadline is next Friday.
Oh, that sounds like a big task. Is there anything else pressing?
Yes, actually, the catering company requires a final head count by this Wednesday.
This anniversary celebration is going to be quite large, so accuracy is key.
Understood, I'll make sure to prioritize the data import first, then focus on the head count.
Thanks for letting me know, Everett.

Question 4 through 6, refer to the following conversation.
Luna, regarding your recent expense report for the business trip, there are a few items I need to clarify.
Certainly, Ryan, what seems to be the issue?
Specifically, the cost related to attire for the X-Corp exhibition.
Our policy states that professional clothing is only reimbursable if it's explicitly required for a specific business event in not part of general professional wear.
Ah, yes, I purchased that for the X-Corp Gallaudinner. It was a formal event, and wearing appropriate attire was crucial for making a strong impression and building rapport with key clients.
I understand the importance of making a good impression, however, for such expenses we require complete transparency regarding the necessity and the amount.
Could you provide a detailed justification in the original receipt?
Of course, I'll prepare a memo outlining the event's purpose and why that particular attire was essential.
I appreciate you clarifying the guidelines.
No problem, Luna, we strive to maintain transparent and fair financial processes for everyone.
Your cooperation is much appreciated.

Question 7 through 9 refer to the following conversation.
Andrew, I'm excited to present our new digital marketing strategy designed specifically for businesses like yours.
Thanks, Nova, to be honest, I'm a bit reluctant about shifting too much of our focus online.
Our strength has always been our strong ties with local customers through traditional methods.
I completely understand your concern. This strategy isn't about abandoning traditional methods, but rather enhancing them.
It allows us to reach a broader audience while still engaging with your existing local clientele more effectively online.
For example, local CEO can bring in new customers searching for services in this area.
So, it's not just about flashy online ads, but more about connecting with people who are actually looking for what we offer, even locally.
Exactly, it's about targeted engagement. We can tailor campaigns to reach specific demographics within your local area, making sure your message resonates with the right people.
We also track the effectiveness so you can see the return on investment.
That sounds more promising. I was reluctant to dive into something that might alienate our current base, but if it helps us grow while maintaining our local presence, I'm willing to explore it further.

Excuse me, Ella, I'm Adrian, a tourist. Could you please tell me how to get to the sky tower?
I'm a bit lost.
Certainly, Adrian, the sky tower isn't far from here. You just need to walk straight down this street for about five minutes, and you'll see it on your right.
However, I highly recommend buying your tickets online immediately because the lines can get very long, especially this time of day.
Oh, that's a great tip. I wouldn't have thought of that. Do they accept credit cards at the entrance if I decide to buy there?
Yes, they do accept credit cards, but as I said, online is much faster. Also, if you plan to visit the museum next door, they have a combined ticket option.
That's good to know. Thanks for all the advice.
