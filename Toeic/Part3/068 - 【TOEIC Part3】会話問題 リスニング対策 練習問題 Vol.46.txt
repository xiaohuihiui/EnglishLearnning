Questions four through six refer to the following conversation.
Claire, thanks for coming in today.
I wanted to discuss the proposal we sent over last week.
Yes, Daniel, I've had a chance to review it.
I must say it's quite detailed.
I have a few questions though.
Of course, fire away.
Firstly, regarding the pricing, I was wondering if there's any room for negotiation.
It's slightly above our projected budget.
We understand, while the initial price reflects the value and quality,
we're always open to discussing different options.
For example, we could adjust the scope of the project to fit your budget.
That sounds promising.
We'd be interested in exploring those options.
Great.
Also, what are your thoughts on the timeline we proposed?
Is that manageable for your team?

Question 7 through 9 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost.
I'm trying to find the grand museum.
Is this the right way?
Oh, you're close.
Actually, it's just around the corner.
But there's a bit of construction on that street, so it's not the most scenic walk right now.
I see.
That's good to know.
Is there another way I could go?
Yes, you can go down this street and take a ride at the Premier Hotel.
It's a slightly longer route, but it avoids the construction.
It's a more pleasant walk.
That sounds perfect.
Thank you so much for the help.
By the way, is it worth paying extra to upgrade a standard ticket at the museum?
Oh, definitely.
The upgraded ticket usually allows access to special exhibits and provides a guided tour.
It's worth it, especially if it's your first time.

Question 10 through 12, refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost.
I'm trying to find the local market, but the map is confusing.
Oh, you're looking for the market?
It's not too far.
You should go straight down this street for about two blocks and you'll see it on your left.
It's a big open area.
Great, thank you.
By the way, I heard there's some kind of music festival this weekend.
Is that correct?
Yes, that's right.
There's a big festival in the park.
They have all kinds of performances, including traditional music.
Although, this year, they've decided to mostly refrain from vocal performances and focus on instrumental pieces.
That sounds interesting.
I was hoping to get a taste of local culture.
Is there any chance I can try some local foods at the festival?
Definitely.
There will be many stalls with local delicacies.
You absolutely should try the famous seafood stew.
It's a local favorite.
