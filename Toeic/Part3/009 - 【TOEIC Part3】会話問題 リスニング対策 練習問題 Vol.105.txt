Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, could you tell me a bit about the recent development in this town?
I'm particularly interested in the new resort being built.
Hello, oh, that resort.
It's expected to bring more tourists, but there are also concerns about its environmental impact.
Many are worried about the consequence of rapid development.
I see, that's complex.
What about the impact on local culture and traditional life?
Are any measures being taken to preserve them?
Yes, that's precisely a point of discussion.
Local community is trying to develop tourism while not losing its unique character.
However, striking that balance is very challenging.
Thank you, as tourists, is there anything we should be mindful of?
For instance, what can we do to support sustainable tourism?
Yes, it's important to support local businesses, dispose of waste properly and respect local culture and customs.
Doing so will lead to positive consequences.

Amelia, I've been seriously thinking about learning some new skills lately.
That's great, William.
What kind of skills are you interested in?
Well, I've been thinking about programming and data analysis, but the range of what I could learn is so vast that I'm not sure where to start.
Yeah, it can be overwhelming when there are too many options.
Given your current circumstance, what kind of skill do you think would be most beneficial for you right now?
For my current project, I feel like data analysis skills would make things much more efficient.
But it's hard to find the time to study.
I understand it's hard when you're busy.
There are online courses and short weekend seminars, so perhaps you could try one of those first?
That's a good idea. Thanks, Amelia.

Hi, Delilah. What seems to be the problem?
Hi, Leo. My design software isn't launching at all. I keep getting an error message.
Hmm, can you tell me what the error says? Is it related to a license issue or network connectivity?
It says, license expired. I thought IT handled all software licenses directly.
For some general office software, yes. But for specialized applications like yours, the license renewal process often needs to go through the vendor.
We can't always renew it directly from our end.
Oh, I see. So what should I do? Should I contact the software company myself?
No, you don't have to. I'll act as a liaison between you and the software vendor support team.
I can help you facilitate the renewal process.
That would be great. Thank you.
So, I just need to provide the details to you?
Exactly. Please send me the exact error message and any license keys you have.
I'll then directly contact their support and guide you through the next steps.

Question 10 through 12, refer to the following conversation.
Hey, Willow. I'm having a bit of trouble with my apartment search. I need to find a new place soon.
Oh, really? What kind of trouble? Is it hard to find a good one?
Yeah, exactly. Everything good seems to be least out so quickly.
And I need to move pretty immediately after my current lease ends next month.
I might actually have a lead for you. My friend Sarah is moving out of her place downtown next month, and it's a really nice one.
Oh, that sounds promising. Is it a good location?
Very close to public transport and a nice park. She's looking for someone to take over her lease, so you wouldn't even have to deal with the landlord directly for the initial part.
That's amazing. Do you think I could see it soon? I really need to secure something immediately.
I can text her right now and ask if you can view it this weekend. She mentioned she's trying to find someone quickly.
