Questions 265 for 267 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Claire, I'm Josiah from Tech Solutions.
I'm calling to follow up on the document you requested last week regarding our software licensing.
Hi Josiah, thanks for calling.
Yes, I received the document, but I have a few questions.
Specifically, about the copyright terms.
Of course, I'm happy to clarify.
What are your concerns about the copyright?
Well, it states that the copyright is held by Tech Solutions, which is understandable.
However, we'd like to know if we can modify the software for internal use.
This document doesn't specify.
That's a valid point. The standard licensing doesn't allow for modifications,
but we can discuss custom agreements that would allow it under certain terms.
We need to modify the document a little to reflect that.
Okay, that's helpful. Please send me a revised document.
Also, regarding the pricing, can we discuss that too?
Certainly, let's schedule another call to go over these details.
How does tomorrow afternoon work for you?

Hi, Lillian. This is Jason from Global Solutions.
I'm calling about the documents he requested. I've just finished preparing them.
Oh, great, Jason. Thank you for the prompt work.
I need those documents urgently for my presentation next week.
You're welcome. I'm just making the final check. I'll send them over via email now, but I have one question.
Do you need the brochures in English or should I translate them into Japanese as well?
Oh, that's a good question.
Yes, please translate the brochures. The audience is mainly Japanese speakers.
Okay, I'll have that done by end of today.
Also, I noticed that we had a slight leak in the data regarding pricing on the last report.
I have corrected it, and I'll resend that along with the other documents.
Oh, thank you for catching that, Jason. That's very helpful. I look forward to receiving them soon.

Have you tried restarting your computer in the program?
Yes, I've done that multiple times. It helps temporarily, but the issues keep recurring.
Okay, and as your system's memory and storage asterisk adequate, we need to ensure the hardware is not the problem.
I believe so, but I'll double check that. I'm not an expert on those technical details.
Alright, let's schedule another meeting for next week. In the meantime, can you note down each specific instance where the software freezes or loses data?
The more detailed information you can provide, the easier it will be for me to diagnose the issue.
Okay, I will do that. Thank you, Parker.
