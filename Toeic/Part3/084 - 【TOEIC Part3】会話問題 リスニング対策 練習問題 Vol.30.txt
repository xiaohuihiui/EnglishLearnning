Question 4 through 6, refer to the following conversation.
Elizabeth, thank you for coming in today.
I'm Anthony, the hiring manager. Your resume looks very impressive.
Thank you, Anthony. It's a pleasure to be here.
I've noticed you have significant experience in project management.
Could you tell me about a time you had to manage a project with a rapidly changing scope?
Certainly. In my previous role, we were developing a new software.
Initially, the scope was quite limited, but as the project progressed,
market demand grew exponentially, and we had to adapt quickly.
That sounds challenging. How did you handle the changes?
We prioritized features rigorously, and I made sure to keep the team informed about all changes.
We also held daily stand-up meetings to adjust to the new priorities and delegate tasks effectively.
We also made the decision to delete some less essential features to stay on schedule.
That's a great approach. It shows your ability to adapt under pressure.
Thank you, Elizabeth. Do you have any questions for me?
Yes, I do. Could you tell me more about the team structure and the opportunities for professional development here?

Hi, Olivia. How's the customer testimonial coming along for this project?
Hi, Roman. I've gathered quite a few and most of them are positive.
However, some customers have noted that the delivery time was a bit slow.

Yes, there are a few. For example, one customer mentioned that the support in their district was exceptionally prompt, which is a great point.
Excellent. We should definitely highlight the positive feedback. As for the delivery issues, I'll have to share that with the team to address them promptly.
Yes, I agree. I will compile more detailed data and share it with you early next week.
