Question 1 through 3, refer to the following conversation.
Ariana, how's the project progress recently?
Hudson, it's going well.
However, we've experienced some unexpected delays recently.
I see, how behind are we, how much later than the original schedule do you expect will be?
We're currently two weeks behind schedule, but the whole team is working hard, and we expect to reduce the delay to within a week.
That's good to hear.
Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

I'm Daniel, and I'll be helping you with your new system installation.
Hi, Daniel, nice to meet you.
I'm excited to get this up and running.
I've heard good things about your company.
Great, before we start, I'd like to understand your preference in terms of data storage.
We have several options, including cloud-based and local servers.
That's a good question.
I'm leaning towards local servers.
We handle a countless amount of sensitive data, and I feel more secure keeping it in house.
I understand you're concerned.
In that case, let's proceed with local server setup then.
Do you have any other specific requirements?
Not at the moment.
Let's get the ball rolling with the local server.
Hi, Aurora.
Thanks for coming in today.

Question 7 through 9 refer to the following conversation.
Ila, have you looked into the new software for data processing?
I'm a bit lost on how to navigate it.
Yes, Elijah, I have.
It's definitely different from what we're used to.
I think there's going to be some disruption to our usual workflow at first.
I agree.
I'm already seeing that.
The interface is completely different.
Do you know if there's any training available?
I heard they're planning a training session next week.
I think we should both attend.
That would make the process much smoother.
That sounds great.
I'll sign us up right away.
Thanks for the info.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Madison, thanks for coming in today.
I wanted to follow up on the installation of the new system.
Of course, Colton, how's everything going on your end?
Well, we've encountered an unprecedented issue with the network connectivity.
It seems the system isn't communicating as we expected.
That's concerning.
What's the root cause?
Have you been able to identify it?
We're still investigating, but preliminary diagnostics refer to a configuration problem with your firewall.
We need to double check the settings.
Okay, I see.
Is there anything I can do to assist?
Perhaps we should schedule another call after you examine the firewall settings?
