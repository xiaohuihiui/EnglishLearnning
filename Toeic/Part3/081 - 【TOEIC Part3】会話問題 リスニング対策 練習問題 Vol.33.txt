Question 1 through 3, refer to the following conversation.
Elinore, have you had a chance to look at the sales figures for the last quarter?
Yes, Joseph, they're showing a moderate increase compared to the previous quarter, which is good, but not as high as we projected.
I see. We need to analyze the reasons behind this. Perhaps the marketing campaign wasn't as effective as we thought.
We need to be responsible for making necessary changes.
I agree. I think we should set up a meeting next week to discuss possible strategies to improve our sales.
Would that work for you? Yes, that works perfectly. Let's do that.

Hi, Arya. Thanks for coming in today. I'm Dylan. So, I understand you're looking for a custom design for your new website.
Yes, that's right, Dylan. I'm excited about launching my online business, and I want a truly spectacular website to match my vision.
Absolutely, we pride ourselves on creating unique and eye-catching designs. What kind of budget are we working with?
Well, I was hoping for a detailed breakdown of costs, but I have a rough estimate of $5,000, with a small allowance for potential adjustments.
Okay, that's good to know. We can certainly work with that. We'll draft a proposal with a few different options, so you can see what fits best with your brand and budget.
When would be a good time to send that to you? Sounds great. Could you send it by end of the week? That would give me some time to review it before we talk again.
