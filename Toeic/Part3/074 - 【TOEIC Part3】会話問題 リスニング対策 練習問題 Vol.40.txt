Okay, I have that. I'll be there in a minute.
Great. Also, could you duplicate the proposal documents we reviewed yesterday?

Questions 4 through 6 refer to the following conversation.
Hi, Alice. Thanks for coming in today. I'm Oliver, the hiring manager.
Hi, Oliver. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for having me.
So, I've reviewed your resume, and it looks very impressive.
But I wanted to ask, you mentioned you are currently working, and it's quite a congested area.
How have you managed your schedule?
Yes, that's right. Commuting has been a challenge, but I've become quite efficient at time management to handle both work and my other commitments.
That's good to hear. I also noticed that you've been reluctant to change jobs for quite some time.
What motivates you to seek a new opportunity at this point in your career?
I've really grown in my current role, but I'm looking for a position that allows me to further develop my skills and take on more challenging projects.
I understand. Well, I think that's all for today. We'll be in touch soon regarding the next steps.
Thank you for your time, Oliver. I appreciate it.

Questions 7 through 9 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Aurora, it's Isaiah. I'm calling about the new software you requested. Have you had a chance to review the specifications we sent over?
Hi Isaiah, yes I have. According to the document, the software should have the ability to handle up to 10,000 users simultaneously, right?
That's correct, and we've included an expandable feature that will allow you to easily scale up further if needed.
That's great. We are planning a big campaign next month and we expect a surge in user traffic.
I also had a question about the user interface. Will it be customizable?
Yes, absolutely. We offer a high degree of customization so you can tailor it to your specific branding and needs.
Is there anything else you would like to know before we move forward with the implementation?

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost. I'm looking for the old town, but this map doesn't seem to fit the streets I'm seeing.
Oh, you're in the middle of a newer phase of the city. The old town is a little further that way. You need to cross the main bridge.
Oh, I see. That makes sense. So, the map I have is not up to date then?
Probably not. They've done a lot of construction around here in the last few years. You might find an updated map at the tourist center near the bridge.
That would fit your needs better.
That's great advice. Thank you so much.
No problem. Enjoy your visit.
