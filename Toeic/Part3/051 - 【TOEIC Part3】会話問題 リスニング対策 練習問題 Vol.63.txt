Good morning, Mam. Where are you headed today?
Good morning. I need to go to the Thompson and Company headquarters on Main Street.
Certainly, it'll take about 20 minutes with the current traffic. By the way, that's quite a sturdy suitcase you have there.
Thank you. I'm heading to an important business conference. I had to find something robust enough to protect all my documents.
I understand. Business trips can be stressful. Are you planning to resolve any particular issues at the conference?
Yes, we need to finalize a new contract with a major client. It's quite crucial for the company's growth.
I wish you the best of luck with that. It seems you are very determined.

Questions four through six refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me. I'm a tourist and I'm a little lost. I'm trying to find the community center. Could you help me?
Sure. I can help. It's not too far from here. Walk straight down this street for about two blocks. Then turn left.
You should see it on your right. They implement many local programs there.
Great. Thank you. Is there anything interesting happening there right now?
Actually, this weekend they're having a craft fair. Local artisans will be selling their work.
And there's also a fundraising event where people can donate money anonymously.
A craft fair sounds interesting. I think I'll check it out. Thanks for your help.
You're welcome. Enjoy your visit.

Hello, Camilla. Thank you for coming in for the interview. My name is Xavier and I'm the hiring manager.
Hello, Xavier. Thank you for having me.
Let's get started. Could you tell me about the employee benefits offer?
Yes, of course. We offer comprehensive health insurance, a retirement plan, paid time off and a carpool program for employees.
A carpool program? That's fantastic. It sounds like it could foster a sense of community among employees.
Yes, it is. We also have a generous maternity and paternity leave policy and employees can take extended leave if needed.
To take extended leave shows that you value your employees. This has been very helpful. Thank you.
You're welcome. Do you have any other questions?

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Good morning, Kennedy. I wanted to discuss the IT budget allocation we talked about in yesterday's meeting.
Good morning, Luca. Yes, of course. Do you have any specific questions?
Yes, specifically about the investment in the new project management software.
Do you have any concrete suggestions on how we should divide the budget?
Well, based on the current analysis and evaluation of the required functions, we have prioritized them.
First, we are considering dividing the budget into software license fees, implementation support, and training costs for employees.
I see. Training is important. Is there anything else? For example, strengthening security measures are dealing with the recent increase in cyber attacks.
Yes, we are also taking that into account. Regarding security, we need to conduct a diagnosis of the entire system to identify and improve vulnerabilities.
A portion of the budget will be allocated to hiring experts for that purpose.
That's good. Please share the results of the diagnosis as soon as possible. We need to develop specific measures based on that.
Understood. I will report on the progress regularly. Thank you for your cooperation.
