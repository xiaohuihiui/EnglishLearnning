Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Charlotte, thanks for coming in today.
I wanted to discuss the recent purchase order for the office furniture.
Hi David, no problem.
I'm glad to be here.
What about it?
I noticed that some items are backquartered and we'll have to wait at least four weeks.
This is going to cause some disruption to our move in timeline.
Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that.
We've been having some issues with our suppliers.
Let me see what I can do to expedite the order.
Perhaps, we can substitute similar items for the backquartered ones.
That would be great.
Also, I wanted to ask about the payment schedule.
Is it possible to delay the final payment by a week?
We're waiting for final approval from the council.
I understand.
Yes, I think we can arrange for a one week extension for the final payment.
I will update the invoice accordingly and send it to you later today.
How does that sound?
That's perfect.
Charlotte, thank you for your flexibility and understanding.
You're very welcome, David.
Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

questions four through six refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me.
me, I'm a tourist here and I was wondering if you could recommend a good place for dinner?
Something not too expensive, maybe something reasonable.
Oh, of course, there's a great little restaurant just around the corner called the cozy
corner.
They have really good pasta and it's pretty reasonably priced.
And if you're into seafood, the seafooders grill is a good choice too, though it might
be a bit more than the cozy corner.
That sounds great, did they take reservations?
I'd like to go tonight.
Yes, I believe they do.
You can call a head to grant your table or just walk in, but it might be busy later on.
Great, thanks for the info.
I will call them now to make a reservation.
No problem at all.
Enjoy your dinner.
