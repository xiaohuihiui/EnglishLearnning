Meela, I've been reviewing the marketing proposals for the new product launch. I'm concerned that we're not doing enough to attract the younger demographic.
I understand your concern, Jamison. We did include some social media campaigns. However, you're right. Maybe it's not enough. What do you suggest?
Well, we've relied too heavily on our traditional advertising methods. Perhaps we should consider influencer marketing and interactive content.
Things that would resonate more with a younger audience.
That's a good idea, Jamison. I'll revise the proposal to include those. We also need to ensure the messaging is more relevant to their lifestyle.
Exactly. Let's aim for a campaign that is both modern and engaging. We've always been good at traditional marketing. Now it's time to embrace the new.

Hi, Camilla. Thanks for coming in today. I'm Wyatt from Hour. It's nice to finally meet you.
Hi, Wyatt. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Thank you for having me.
So, I've looked over your resume and it seems like you've had quite a bit of experience in project management. Can you tell me about a time you had to deal with a major setback in a project?
Yes, in my previous role, we had a major complaint from a client about the delivery schedule. We had to completely reassess the timeline and reallocate resources, but we managed to recover in the end.
That sounds like a tough situation. How did you go about ensuring the project still met its goals and deadlines despite the issues?
I communicated transparently with the team and the client. We adjusted our work hours and everyone contributed additional effort to catch up.
We also made sure to keep the client updated with our progress every step of the way. It was a learning experience for sure, but ultimately, we earned back the client's trust.

Questions 130-132 refer to the following conversation.
Grace, I'm a bit concerned about the upcoming project deadline. It seems like we're falling behind.
I agree, William. We need to find a way to facilitate our work flow. Maybe we should try a new project management tool?
That's a good idea. I've heard some of them can really enable better task assignment and tracking.
Do you have any specific tools in mind?
Yes, I've been researching a few. I think one called taskmaster could be very helpful.
Okay, let's look into taskmaster then. Perhaps we can schedule a quick meeting to discuss implementation?
That sounds perfect. I'll send out a meeting and invite this afternoon.
