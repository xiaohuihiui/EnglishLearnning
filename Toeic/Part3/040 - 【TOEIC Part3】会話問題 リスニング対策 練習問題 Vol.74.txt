Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Harper, thanks for coming. I wanted to show you the initial design concept for our new
luxury line product, the Nova. We're aiming for a very sleek and sophisticated look.
Looks impressive, Isaiah. I can see you've put a lot of thought into the aesthetics.
This curved glass panel, for instance, is quite unique. However, realizing this design might
heavily rely on advanced manufacturing techniques. Yes, I know it's ambitious,
but the luxury positioning of this product demands a distinctive appearance.
What are the main technical challenges you foresee with this particular element?
Precision molding for that curvature will be difficult and costly. Also, integrating the
electronic seamlessly behind it without affecting the transparency or requiring thick
bezels will be a significant engineering effort. It will heavily impact our production timeline
and budget. Harper, thanks for coming. I wanted to show you the initial design concept

Questions 4-6 refer to the following conversation.
Well, Isabella, thank you for coming in today. We've covered quite a bit. Do you have any
final questions for me regarding the position or the company?
Thank you, Carson. I appreciate you taking the time. No, I think all my questions have been answered.
I feel very positive about this opportunity. I made sure to prepare thoroughly beforehand.
That's excellent to hear. Your preparation was evident. We expect to make a decision and notify
candidates within the next week. If you are successful, we often organize a casual team outing
shortly after the new person joins to help everyone get acquainted. Oh, that sounds like a great idea.
It's always helpful to bond with colleagues outside of the office environment.
Exactly. Well, Isabella, we'll be in touch soon. Thank you again for your time today.
Thank you, Carson. Good bye.

Question 7 through 9 referred to the following conversation.
Hey, Eleanor. Thanks for meeting me. I wanted to talk about the community outreach program.
Hi, Elias. Sure. What's up? Well, I've been reviewing the feedback forms.
I think we need to recognize that our current advertising isn't reaching enough people in the
target demographic. I agree. We've had lower turnout than expected at the last few events.
What about resources? Do you think the budget for materials is adequate? Honestly,
I don't think it is. We need more leaflets and posters and maybe even some online ads,
but the allocated funds are pretty tight. So, lack of reach and insufficient budget for materials.
Those are significant issues. What can we do? Maybe we can look for local businesses that would
be willing to sponsor some advertising costs. And perhaps try using social media more effectively
for free. That's a good idea, Elias. We definitely need to boost our visibility.
