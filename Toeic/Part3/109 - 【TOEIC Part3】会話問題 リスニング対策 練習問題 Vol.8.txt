Question 85 through 87 refer to the following conversation.
Valentina, I'd like to discuss the progress on the new organic fertilizer project.
Of course, Jason, we've completed the initial testing and the results look promising.
That's great news. Have you done a thorough analysis of the cost effectiveness?
Yes, we have. The initial costs are a bit higher due to the organic materials, but the long-term benefits should outweigh those.
Okay, good. I also want to make sure we're targeting the right farmers for distribution.
Any updates on that? We are compiling a list of local farms interested in sustainable practices.
We'll have that ready by next week.

Question's 88th through 90, refer to the following conversation.
Emory, I need to talk to you about the Johnson account. We've been receiving complaints about late deliveries.
Yes, Wesley, I'm aware of the issue. There was an unexpected delay in our shipping department last week.
That's not acceptable. We need to address this immediately.
What actions have you taken to resolve the situation?
I've already contacted the shipping department to ensure there will be no further delays.
I also offered a small discount to the Johnson company to try to make up for the inconvenience.
However, they are still not happy and they mentioned they want to charge us a penalty.
A penalty charge? This is bad news. We can't afford to have another delay like this. Please provide a detailed report of what happened by the end of the day.
We need to prevent this from happening again.

Question 91 through 93 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Savannah. Thanks for coming in today. I'm Parker, the hiring manager. Let's get started.
Hi Parker, it's a pleasure to be here. Thank you for having me. So, I've reviewed your resume
and it looks like you have a lot of relevant experience. I see that your certifications expire
next month. Yes, that's correct. I'm already in the process of renewing them. It generally takes
a few weeks, but I expect to have them updated before I start any new role. That's good to hear.
We generally like candidates to have all their certifications up to date when they start with us.
So, this wouldn't be a problem. I understand. I wanted to be transparent about that from the start.

Questions 94 for 96 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Gabriella, do you have a moment? I wanted to discuss the employee training program.
Sure, William. I'm free now. What's on your mind? Well, we received feedback that some employees
feel they need more advanced training, especially regarding the new software. I was thinking we
should analyze the current skill levels. That's a good idea. We could also look into offering
additional training sessions. I know there are some online certificate programs that some people
have been inquiring about. Exactly. We should investigate those certificate programs and see if they
align with our training needs. I think it would be beneficial to some of the employees. I agree.
We need to make sure everyone has the necessary skills for their roles. I will start researching
the certificate options and get back to you with a proposal.
