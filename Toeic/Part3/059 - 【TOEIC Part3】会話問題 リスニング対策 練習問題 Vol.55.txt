Questions 1 through 3 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Lilliana, thanks for coming in today. I'm Santiago and I'll be interviewing you.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Santiago. I'm excited to be here.
Great. Let's start with a question about your previous experience.
I see from your resume that you have some highly relevant project management experience.
Can you tell me more about that?
Certainly. In my previous role, I managed multiple projects simultaneously,
focusing on meeting deadlines and staying within budget.
I also had to refer to project documents constantly to keep the whole team on the same page.
That sounds impressive. Can you give me an example of a time when you had to handle a difficult situation during one of those projects?
Of course, there was one time when the requirements for a project changed unexpectedly halfway through.
It was very stressful, but I managed to get the whole team to refer to the new requirement documents,
and we successfully adjusted our plans to finish it.

Question 4 through 6, refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost. Is there a good local restaurant around here that's not too expensive?
I'm on a tight budget. Oh, sure. There's a great little place called known as kitchen, just a couple of blocks that way.
It's very popular with locals, and it won't break the budget. They have amazing pasta.
That sounds perfect. I was also wondering if there are any interesting walking routes nearby.
I'd love to explore the city a bit more.
Absolutely. If you walk along the river, you'll find a beautiful path.
But be careful. There's a bit of a lapse in the signage near the old bridge, so you might have to rely on your map for that part.
Thanks a lot. This is really helpful. I really appreciate the local insight.
You're welcome. Enjoy your time here.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Victoria, thanks for coming in today. I wanted to discuss your performance this quarter.
Of course, Evan, I'm ready to hear your feedback.
Overall, your contributions have been solid. However, I noticed a slight dip in productivity last month. Is there anything I can assist you with?
Yes, actually. I've been having some issues with the new software device we're using.
It's been a bit of a learning curve and has slowed down my workflow.
I understand, we want everyone to be comfortable and efficient, perhaps we can arrange additional training on the device for you and your team.
That way, everyone can be more prosperous and have less stress.
That would be fantastic, Evan. I really appreciated.
