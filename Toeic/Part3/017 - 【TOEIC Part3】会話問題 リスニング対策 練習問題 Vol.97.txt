Come, I see.
We've been experiencing some network instability today.

It just says access denied.
I have an urgent project deadline, so I really need to get this fixed soon.
I understand.
I'll connect remotely to your computer to diagnose the issue.
If it's a server side problem, we might have to reschedule the scheduled system update for this evening to address it immediately.
Oh, I hope it's not too serious.
Let me know what you find out.
We'll do.
I'll give you an update within the next hour.

Question 7 through 9, refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a tourist here and I'm looking for a good grocery store.
Do you know any good ones around?
Oh, welcome.
Yes, there are a few.
What kind of grocery items are you looking for?
Just some basic things, maybe some local snacks if possible.
I'm staying near the city center.
In that case, I'd recommend fresh market on Main Street.
It's quite large and has a good selection of both common groceries and local produce.
It's about a 10 minute walk from here.
That sounds perfect.
Are there prices reasonable?
And do they have anything unique that I should definitely try?
Their prices are fair.
And yes, you must try their locally baked bread and the artisanal cheese selection.
Many tourists go there just for that.
Wonderful.
Thank you so much for the detailed information.
I think I can conclude that fresh market is exactly what I need.
You're welcome.
Enjoy your shopping and your stay.

Question 10 through 12 referred to the following conversation.
Excuse me.
I'm Xavier, a tourist from out of town.
Could you perhaps recommend a good place to visit around here?
Of course, I'm Kinsley.
Welcome to our city.
Well, recently, the Old Town Hall was renovated and turned into a fantastic local history museum.
It's been quite popular.
That sounds interesting.
Is it far from the main university campus?
I've heard the faculty of arts there has a wonderful public gallery.
Not at all, actually.
The museum is just a short walk from the university's main entrance.
The arts faculty gallery is indeed impressive, but the new history museum offers a unique insight into our city's heritage.
