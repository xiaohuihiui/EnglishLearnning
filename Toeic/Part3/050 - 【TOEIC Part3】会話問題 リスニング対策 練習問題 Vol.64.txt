Question 1 through 3, refer to the following conversation.
Hi Ivy, thanks for coming in today.
So, tell me, why are you interested in this marketing position?
Hi Lincoln, thanks for having me.
I've been following your company's innovative campaigns for years,
and I'm eager to contribute my skills to a team that values creativity.
That's great to hear. We're always looking for fresh perspectives.
We are currently trying to improve our employee satisfaction,
and one thing we're considering is offering an incentive for employees who cartpool.
What are your thoughts on that?
I think that's a fantastic idea.
It encourages teamwork, reduces the company's carbon footprint,
and helps employees save money on commuting.
It's a win-win situation.
Exactly, we also want to see how it affects punctuality,
but these are the types of measures we want our new hires to support.
Now, moving on, can you tell me about a time when you had to work under pressure to meet a deadline?
Certainly, in my previous role at previous company,
we were tasked with launching a new product in a very short time frame.

If, still.
We went through 6 conditions.
Good morning, Miss Ava.
Thank you for coming in today.
I'm Andrew and I'll be assisting you with opening a business account.
Good morning, Andrew. I'm excited to finally get this set up.
My business, green solutions, is starting to really take off and I need a proper business account to manage everything.
That's fantastic to hear.
We offer several different business account options.
What kind of transactions will you primarily be making?
And will you need online banking access?
Mostly electronic transfers and some check deposits.
Online banking is a must.
Also, I'm hoping to secure a small business loan in the near future to help us expand and compete with larger companies in the environmental sector.
Excellent. We have several loan programs designed for growing businesses like yours.
I can provide you with information on those after we set up your account.
And if you would like to learn more about financial information, our CEO will give a keynote speech in the next month.
That sounds great. Thanks so much, Andrew.
Let's get started.

Hello, Skylar.
Thank you for coming today. My name is Isaiah and I'm the technical lead for this project.
Hello, Isaiah. Thank you for your time.

Thank you. We will do our best to ensure the success of this project for your company.
First, let's reconfirm the final destination.
What specific outcomes are you hoping for?
Well, the primary goal is to significantly improve customer satisfaction.
To achieve that, we believe it's essential to streamline our existing systems and provide new customer experiences.
I understand. In that case, I'd like to propose a few concrete plans to achieve both efficiency improvements and enhanced customer experience.
Would it be possible for us to give you a detailed presentation next Tuesday?
Tuesday works for me. I'm looking forward to it. By the way, I heard that your company holds an annual gala.
When is it scheduled for this year?
Thank you. The gala is scheduled to be held in mid December as usual.
Once the details are finalized, we would be delighted to invite you, Skylar.

I'm a big concerned about the turnout for next week's Product Exhibit. A initial registration
is expected. I see, Aaron. That's not ideal. Did we send out all the email reminders? And what about the social media campaign?
Yes, all reminders went out. The social media campaign is running, but engagement seems low. We might need to supplement our efforts with something more direct.
I agree. How about we offer a special discount coupon at local businesses? It could attract more attendees.
That's a great idea, Ruby. I'll get to work on designing the coupon and coordinating with businesses right away.
Thanks for the suggestion.
No problem, Aaron. Let's also make sure the exhibit itself is as engaging as possible.
Perhaps a live demonstration or interactive display?
Excellent point. I'll explore those options too. With these strategies, I'm confident we can boost attendance.
