Hello, Piper. How was the recent briefing session on performance review?
Do you have any questions about the new evaluation system?
Yes, Parker. The briefing was very informative. However, I felt that the new evaluation criteria
demand quite a lot from employees. I'm especially concerned about the countless new skills
required compared to our previous duties. I understand your concerns. We are aware of the demand
for acquiring new skills. That's why we have prepared countless training programs and established
a system to fully support employee skill development. We also offer individual counseling so you
can approach it without anxiety. That's reassuring. Could you tell me more about the details of the
training programs? I'm especially interested to know if there are any that align with my career path.
Certainly, next week, I can provide you with a document outlining the specific training schedule
and content for each department. Please rest assured that customization to individual career paths
is also possible. Hello, Piper. How was the recent briefing session on performance reviews?

Questions 4-6 refer to the following conversation. Of course, there's plenty to see
the old town in the new district, for example, contrast greatly in atmosphere.
The old town has historical charm, while the new district has seen recent updates with more
modern facilities. That's interesting. What about transportation? The old town is best explored on
foot, but for the new district, the tram is convenient. The schedules have been recently updated,
so you can check them on a smartphone app. Thank you. Are there any special events happening?
Yes, there's a traditional market in the old town every weekend. The types of stalls
there also contrast significantly from how they used to be. They used to mainly offer local
produce, but now you'll find more handicrafts.

How are we progressing with the promotional materials?
Hello, Adrian. We're making good progress. The first draft of the new flyer designs,
highlighting the diverse cuisine options, is ready for your review.
I was just about to send it. Perfect timing. I'm particularly keen to ensure the unique
aspects of each cuisine are well represented. Also, we need to finalize the printing schedule.
What's the timeline looking like for the full print run? Based on our current schedule,
once we receive your final approval on the design, we can have the first batch of flyers
delivered to your restaurants by next Friday. We've already secured the paper stock.
That sounds good. One more thing, have you started thinking about the digital campaign for the new
menu launch? We want to ensure a consistent message across all platforms. Yes, I've already prepared
a preliminary proposal for the online ads and social media posts. I can include that in the email
with the flyer designs for your review. It emphasizes the exotic flavors and the quality of the
ingredients. Excellent, Clara. Please send everything over. I'll review it this afternoon and get
back to you with any feedback. We'll do, Adrian. Expect the email shortly. Thank you.

Question 10 through 12. Refer to the following conversation.
Samantha, do you have a moment? I'd like to go over your recent expense report from the Tokio business trip.
Certainly, Andrew. I have all my receipts here. Great. I'm just reviewing this one entry here.
Local pharmacy minus 1,500 yen. Could you explain what this was for? Oh, yes. I developed a
slight cough and a sore throat during the trip, so I purchased some over the countermedicine at a nearby
pharmacy. It was quite unexpected. I see. That makes sense. And what about this Tokio City tour bus
receipt? Was this part of the business activities? Yes, it was. The company arranged a cultural
excursion for all attendees on the last afternoon of the seminar. It was a mandatory part of
the program to foster team building an appreciation of local culture. Understood. So, it was a company
sponsored event. Thank you for clarifying. Samantha, I'll process these.
