Question 1 through 3, refer to the following conversation.
Savannah, thanks for coming in. I wanted to discuss your recent performance review.
Of course, Jose, I'm ready.
Overall, you've been doing great. Your dedication to your projects is evident and the feedback from
your colleagues is positive. But there's one area where we can see some improvement.
Your use of the new software device is a little below average.
Oh, I see. I knew that would come up. I've been struggling with it, to be honest.
It feels like there are countless functions to learn.
I understand. We offer additional training sessions every other week that you might find helpful.
They cover each function in detail. I can sign you up right now.
That would be fantastic, Jose. Thank you.
Also, the IT department has created some short video tutorials specifically designed for that device.
They are available on the company's internet.
Oh, that's great to know. I'll definitely check them out.

After 6, refer to the following conversation.
Hi, Allison. This is Sebastian from Tech Solutions.
I'm calling to follow up on our meeting last week. How are you doing today?
Hi, Sebastian. I'm good. Thanks. We've been reviewing the proposal you sent over and I had a couple
of questions. Sure. Happy to answer them. What's on your mind?
Well, I'm a bit concerned about the accessibility of the software.
Will our team be able to easily use all of its features?
Yes, definitely. The software is designed to be user friendly and accessible for everyone.
We also provide training sessions to ensure a smooth transition. The goal is to make sure your
team can effectively use all of the features which will result in better productivity.
That sounds good. Also, I was wondering about the timeline.
When can we expect the full implementation? We're aiming for within six weeks of contract signing.
We can discuss this in more detail if you like.

Natalie, thanks for coming in. I wanted to discuss your recent performance. Your work quality
is generally excellent, but I've noticed a few minor issues with deadlines.
I understand, Alexander. I've been trying to manage my time better.
I'm aware that missing deadlines can affect the company's reputation.
Yes, it's crucial that we maintain a strong reputation for timely delivery.
Also, I want to talk about your paycheck. Did you receive the correct amount this month?
I believe so, Alexander. I haven't checked it closely yet, but I will.
Thank you for pointing that out. Great. Let's try to work on these minor issues.
I have faith in you, Natalie.

I'm a bit concerned about the section on
document circulation. Yes, Oliver. I did. I agree. The current system seems a little inefficient.
What specifically is bothering you about the circulation process? Well, it seems like some people
aren't receiving crucial information on time, and it's causing some delays in project timelines.
We might need an amendment to ensure a smoother flow. I see your point, perhaps we could
suggest a change to the distribution method, maybe utilizing a digital platform more actively.
That might speed up the circulation and help keep everyone on the same page.
We could propose an amendment with specific recommendations. That's a great idea, Madeline.
Let's work on drafting an amendment proposal together and present it to the management next week.
I'm sure there'll be receptive to improvements that address the current issues.
Madeline, have you seen the latest draft of the company policy?
