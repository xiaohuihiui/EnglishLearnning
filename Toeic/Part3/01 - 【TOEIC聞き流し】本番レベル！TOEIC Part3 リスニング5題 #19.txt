Question 13 through 15 referred to the following conversation.
Hi, I purchased a laptop from your store last week,
and I'd like to return it. I have the receipt here.
I see. May I ask what the problem is? If there's a defect,
we can exchange it for a new one. No, it works fine. I just realized
I need a model with more storage capacity for my video editing work.
This one only has 256 gigabytes. I understand.
Since it's within our 14-day return period and the item is unused,
I can process a full refund. However, there's a model with 512 gigabytes
on sale this week. Would you be interested in upgrading?
Question 13. Why does the woman want to return the laptop?
