Welcome to the future of technology, Summit, Zoey.
I'm Everett, one of the event organizers.
It's great to have you here.
Hi Everett, I'm so excited to be here.
I've heard a lot about the event, especially the excellent lineup for the panel discussions.
Yes, we've put a lot of effort in decorating those.
Just a quick reminder, recording any of the sessions, including the panel discussions, is strictly prohibited
to ensure the privacy and comfort of our speakers and attendees.
Oh, I understand, so no video or audio recording at all during the panel sessions?
That's correct.
We appreciate your understanding, but please feel free to take notes and engage with the speakers
during the queue and a segments of each panel.
Got it, that sounds fair.
I'm really looking forward to the insights from the experts on the AI ethics panel later this afternoon.
