Ah, jet lag can be tough. What have you tried so far?
Not much, really. I've been trying to just tough it out, but my sleep schedule is completely off.
I always find that getting out into the sunshine helps a lot.
Try to expose yourself to natural light during the day.
Also, there's a new cafe that back quote recently back quote opened near the main square.
Maybe a change of scenery and some fresh air there would help.

Thanks for the tip about the cafe.

Question 7 through 9.
Areyana, do you have a few minutes?
I wanted to discuss the new marketing campaign I'm planning.
Of course, ever it.
What's on your mind?
I'm always interested in how marketing can support the sales team.
Great.
So, I'm looking at a campaign focused on small businesses, perhaps a series of webinars and
some targeted online ads.
To make the webinars high quality, I think we'll need to hire an external vendor for video
production.
An external vendor, that sounds like a significant investment.
Have you thought about the budget and the approval process?
Yes, I have a preliminary budget estimate, but it definitely needs management approval.
I plan to submit the proposal next week.
Okay, from a sales perspective, it would be helpful to ensure the webinar topics address
common pain points our small business clients face.
I can share some feedback from recent calls if you'd like.
That would be extremely helpful, Arianna.
The success of this campaign really depends on how well it aligns with the sales effort.

This is Kennedy from XYZ Solutions.
Hi Kennedy, what's up?
