Hi Josephine, it's Daniel. I'm calling to follow up on our meeting last week. I was hoping to get your thoughts on the proposal I sent over.
Hi Daniel, yes, I've had a chance to look it over. Overall, it seems promising, but I do have a few questions about the pricing structure.
Of course, I'm happy to clarify. I can send over a breakdown of the costs. Actually, if you're free sometime this week, I could come by for a quick face to face meeting.
That would be helpful. Let me check my schedule. Also, I was wondering if the proposal includes any solutions for more ordinary tasks like data entry and reporting.
Yes, absolutely. We have a range of options for those tasks. I can walk you through those when we meet. I'll send you an invitation with some available time shortly.
