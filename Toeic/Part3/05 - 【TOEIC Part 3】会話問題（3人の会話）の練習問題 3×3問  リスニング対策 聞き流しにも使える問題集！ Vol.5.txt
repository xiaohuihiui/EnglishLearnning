[04:13] Welcome to Kendall's department store.
[04:15] Today we're giving a demonstration of our wonderful new food dehydrator.
[04:20] Dehydration is the process of drying food by removing water from it.

[04:24] Does anybody here already own one of these devices?
[04:28] I do.
[04:29] Drying makes food smaller and lighter, so I usually buy fruit from a grocery store and

[04:34] then dehydrate it at home for camping trips.
[04:38] Dehydrating usually takes quite long, about 14 hours in most machines, but our latest
[04:43] food dehydrator does the exact same work in only half the time.

[04:48] I would like to try this, but it's an expensive product.
[04:51] If I'm not happy with it, can I return it?
[04:54] Absolutely.
