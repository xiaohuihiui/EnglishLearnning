Question 10 through 12, refer to the following conversation.
Lillian, I wanted to discuss the upcoming Road Maintenance Project. We need to repay the section near the main entrance.
Yes, Luke. I've been looking at the budget for that. How do you plan to proceed?
I was thinking we should use a new type of asphalt that's more durable. It's a bit more expensive up front, but it will reduce the need for frequent repairs.
That sounds like a good long-term solution. I'm sure the team would appreciate that. How can I contribute to this?
Could you handle the vendor negotiations and get quotes for the materials? That would be a great help.
Of course, I can do that. I'll get to it right away.
