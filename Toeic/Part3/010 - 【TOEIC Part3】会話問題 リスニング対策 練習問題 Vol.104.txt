Questions 4-6 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Addison, it's Cooper from the IT Department.
I'm calling about a really urgent matter concerning our server storage.
Oh, hello Cooper, Addison from Facility Management here.
What seems to be the issue?
We're almost out of space on our main servers and we desperately need to expand our storage capacity.
We're talking about a significant upgrade that needs to happen very soon.
I understand, so you're looking for physical space for new server racks, and perhaps specific environmental controls like cooling?
Exactly, plus we need to carefully plan the data migration, especially for our existing tenants, our major corporate clients.
We can't afford any downtime for them.
Ah, the client data, that makes sense, we do have some available space on the third floor that could potentially be converted, but it might require some rearrangement of our current inventory storage.
That sounds promising, Addison.
How soon could we get access to it?
We're under a lot of pressure from senior management.
Let me check the schedule and speak with the property manager immediately.
We'd also need to ensure the power supply and cooling systems are adequate for your new storage equipment.
I'll get back to you with a detailed plan by the end of the day.

Through nine, refer to the following conversation.
Mr. Jamison, do you have a moment?
I wanted to check if I can get reimbursement for some professional periodicals I'd like to subscribe to for a new project.
Of course, Eva, what kind of periodical are they?
If they're directly related to your work, they're usually approved.
Yes, they're essential for keeping up with the latest industry trends and technological innovations.
I'm confident they'll significantly improve our team's efficiency.
I see, for approval, you'll need to submit a simple application form.
Please describe how these periodicals will contribute to your work productivity,
specifically from the perspective of the labor saved in research and analysis.
I see, so I should emphasize how this information will make my labor more efficient, right?
Exactly.
Ideally, you should show how that reduction in labor will ultimately benefit the company.
Understood.
The application will need approval from your direct supervisor and then our final internal review.
This process usually takes a few days.
Okay, I'll proceed with it.
Thank you for your prompt assistance.
You're welcome.
Aquiring specialized knowledge is an important investment that enhances our overall company's labor efficiency in the long run.
I completely agree.
