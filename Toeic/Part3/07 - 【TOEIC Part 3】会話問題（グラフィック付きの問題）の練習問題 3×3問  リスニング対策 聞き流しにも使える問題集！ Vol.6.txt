[00:00] Thank you for watching!
[00:30] Question 32-34 refer to the following conversation and review.
[00:43] Daniel, did you read the article in Dining Digest magazine with a list of the best local restaurants?

[00:49] The article gave us five stars in the menu selection category. You should be proud as our head chef.
[00:55] Yes, I saw that article and I'm glad I decided to add a vegetarian section to the menu last summer.
[01:01] I guess customers really appreciate healthy food choices.

[01:05] True, but it's unfortunate that our other ratings weren't as good.
[01:09] It's not surprising that we scored low in the category of price, but I am surprised by the one that only received three stars.
[01:16] We should work on improving that next year.
