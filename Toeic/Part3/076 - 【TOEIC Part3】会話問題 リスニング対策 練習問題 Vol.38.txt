Questions 1-3 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Audrey, thanks for coming in today.
I've made some progress on the design of the new system,
but I wanted to discuss a few points with you before moving forward.
Hi Sebastian, thanks for the update.
I'm eager to see how it's progressing.
What points did you have in mind?
Well, firstly, regarding the user interface,
I'm considering simplifying it a bit based on our previous discussions.
I believe it could make the system more user-friendly,
but I wanted to get your input.
That sounds promising.
User-friendlyness is definitely a priority for us.
Could you be a bit more specific about the changes you are thinking of?
Sure, I was thinking about reducing the number of options in the main menu
and using a more intuitive icon system.
Also, the module for report generation needs some work.
It isn't as informative as I had hoped, so we should revise that.
I have a few ideas to make the data easier to understand.
Okay, those sound like very useful changes.
Simplifying the menu and making the report more informative are great goals.
Let's discuss it further.
