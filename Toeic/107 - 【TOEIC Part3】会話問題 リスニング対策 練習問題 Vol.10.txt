Questions 1-1-2 through 114 refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me, I'm a bit lost. Is this the right way to the old town square?
Well, you can get there this way, but it's a very indirect route.
It's usually quite crowded and can obstruct pedestrian flow, especially during the day.
It might not be the best route if you're in a hurry.
Oh, I see. I wanted to see the historical sites, but I don't want to waste time if it's going to be so slow.
I'm trying to maximize my productivity during my trip.
If you want to get there faster, I'd recommend going through the park.
It's much quicker and quite pleasant, plus you'll avoid the crowds on the main street.
It's just a bit longer to walk.
That sounds perfect. Thank you. I appreciate the tip.
