Hello, Piper. I've received your expense report. There are a few
items I need to clarify. Okay, Wesley, what seems to be the issue? Firstly, this dinner
expense for a client. While client meals are generally reimbursable, if there wasn't a clear
business purpose, you might be liable for the cost yourself. Oh, it was a networking event,
but no specific client meeting took place. I'll clarify that. Also, the travel expenses
for the conference last month. The approval for that trip is still tentative. We haven't
received the final sign-off from the department head yet. I see. So, it's not fully
approved yet? Exactly. We're processing it based on a preliminary approval, but the
final reimbursement depends on the head's decision. We expect the final status by tomorrow.
Okay, I understand. Thank you for the clarification, Wesley.

Hi, Piper. Do you have a moment? I wanted to ask about the project update.
Sure, Erin. What's up? I just sent out the latest information.
Oh, you did? I must have missed it. My inbox is a bit full. Is everything included in one document?
Yes, I compiled everything into a digital packet. It includes the updated timeline, progress notes,
and the preliminary budget figures. I also made a summary entry in the project journal.
Great. Thanks. I need the timeline specifically for the client meeting this afternoon.
I'll look for that packet right away. Okay. And remember, we still need to review the final
presentation slides before the end of the day.

Questions 10 through 12 refer to the following conversation.
Hi Gabriel. I'm having some trouble with my computer's file storage.
It seems to be getting full very quickly.
Hi Olivia. Yes, we've had a few reports about that.
It's a common issue with our current storage system as our data needs grow.
It's making it difficult to save new documents and affecting performance.
I understand. The good news is that the IT department is exploring some new,
more innovative storage solutions.
Oh, really? What kind of solutions?
We're looking into a cloud-based system that offers much more flexible storage capacity
and better ways to manage large files.
That sounds promising. Will it be easy for employees to transition to?
Yes, ease of use is a priority.
We plan to roll out the new storage system in phases with training sessions.
Okay, that's good to know. Thanks for the update, Gabriel.
