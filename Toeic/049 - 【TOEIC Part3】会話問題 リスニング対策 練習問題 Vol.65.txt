Questions four through six refer to the following conversation.
Excuse me. I bought this item here last week and I have a complaint about it.
Hello, man. I'm Ian. I'm sorry to hear that.
What seems to be the problem?
It's this electric kettle.
It's supposed to shut off automatically when the water boils, but it doesn't.
It just keeps boiling, which is quite dangerous.
I'm very unhappy with this product.
Oh, I see. That sounds like a serious issue.
Do you have your receipt with you?
Yes, I do. Here it is.
Given that it's a safety issue, I demand a full refund for this defective product.
Thank you. Let me check the receipt and our store policy.
Yes, according to our policy for a confirmed defect,
we can offer either a full refund or a replacement.
Based on your complaint in demand, a full refund is certainly an option.
A refund is what I prefer, please.
All right. We can process that for you right now.
I apologize again for the inconvenience caused by the faulty product.

Question 7 through 9 referred to the following conversation.
Excuse me. I'm visiting the city for the first time.
Could you tell me a little about the surrounding area?
Certainly. What kind of information are you looking for?
Attractions, places to eat or transportation.
Mostly attractions and how to get around. I have an old map,
but I'm not sure how accurate it is for the surrounding areas.
Ah, an old map might not be up to date with recent changes.
For the most current information on the surrounding attractions and transport links,
you really should consider an upgrade to a newer source.
And upgrade? What kind of upgrade are you suggesting?
Well, the official city tourism website or a popular local app
would provide real-time information on everything in the surrounding area,
including opening hours and temporary closures.
That sounds very helpful. My map doesn't show the new pedestrian street in the surrounding district.
Exactly. Using digital resources is often the best way to navigate the surrounding area efficiently now.
Okay. I'll look into that. Thank you for the advice.
You're welcome. Enjoy exploring the surrounding area.

Hello, Luna. This is Owen from Green Solutions.
I'm calling about your new product, EcoClean.
Hi, Owen. Thanks for calling.
Yes. EcoClean is our latest environmental friendly laundry detergent.
Great. I heard it's a different type from your previous products.
Is it a concentrated formula?
Yes. It absolutely is. It's a highly concentrated liquid detergent.
This means you only need a small amount for a full load, which is better for the environment and safe space.
That sounds very efficient. What about the packaging? Is it eco-friendly as well?
Yes. The bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic and is fully recyclable.
We've put a lot of effort into making the entire product sustainable.
Excellent. I'm very interested. Could you send us some samples?
Certainly. I can arrange that for you right away.
Could you confirm the shipping address?
It's the same as before. 123 Ogavano.
Thanks so much, Luna.
You're welcome. Owen. I'll get those samples out to you by tomorrow.
