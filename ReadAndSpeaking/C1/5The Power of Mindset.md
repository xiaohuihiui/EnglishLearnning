**“The Power of Mindset”**

Your mindset shapes your daily reality.
It affects how you face challenges.
A fixed mindset fears making mistakes.
A growth mindset sees them as lessons.

Believing you can improve is vital.
Effort becomes meaningful, not frustrating.
You begin to welcome hard tasks.
Obstacles become chances to get better.

The way you speak matters too.
Saying “I can’t” limits your brain.
Try saying “I can’t yet.”
That small shift opens new doors.

Your thoughts become your direction.
So choose thoughts that push forward.
Mindset isn’t magic, but it’s powerful.
It’s the seed of all progress.
