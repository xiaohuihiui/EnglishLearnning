There will be days you struggle.
The path won’t always be clear.
Doubt will whisper in your mind.
Failure may visit more than once.

But giving up ends the journey.
It closes the door too soon.
Progress takes time, strength, and patience.
Even slow steps still move forward.

Remind yourself why you started.
Look back at how far you’ve come.
You’ve already overcome so much.
You are stronger than you believe.

Rest if you must, then rise.
Your effort is never wasted.
