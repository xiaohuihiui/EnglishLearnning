**Use It or Lose It**

Learning a language is not just about remembering—it's about **using what you know**. You can study grammar rules, memorize vocabulary, and understand theory. But if you don't use your knowledge, it fades.

**Speaking, writing, reading, and listening all help you keep what you've learned.** Practice doesn't make perfect—**practice makes permanent**. Every time you **read aloud, speak with someone, or write a short message**, your brain strengthens the connections.


Don't worry about being perfect. The goal is to **stay active**. **Repeat words**. Say them in different sentences. **Use new phrases in daily life**. The more often you practice, the easier it becomes.

Even **five minutes a day makes a difference**. Try using **new words in real conversations**. **Challenge yourself to explain things in English**.

Remember: **what you use, you keep. What you ignore, you lose.** So speak. Write. Read. Repeat. **Keep your skills alive—use them every day.**
