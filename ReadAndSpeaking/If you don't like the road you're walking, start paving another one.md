"If you don't like the road you're walking, start paving another one."

You're not stuck. Even if it feels that way right now, you have the power to change direction. If the path you're on doesn't make you happy, doesn't feel right, or isn't leading where you want to go—you don't have to keep walking it.

It takes courage to stop, turn around, and start creating your own way. But that's how real change begins. One new step. One brave choice.

You don't have to know exactly where you're going yet. Just start with what feels more true to you. Little by little, you'll build a road that actually feels like yours.

So—what's one small step you can take today to start paving your own path?
