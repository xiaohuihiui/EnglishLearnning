Let's talk about American English. American English is characterized by its unique vocabulary, such as using "elevator" instead of "lift" and "truck" instead of "lorry," as well as its simpler spelling conventions, like "color" instead of "colour." It also has distinct pronunciation features, particularly the rhotic accent, where the "r" at the end of words is pronounced. In terms of grammar, American English tends to favor the past simple tense over the present perfect, using phrases like "I already ate" rather than "I have already eaten." Additionally, it includes idiomatic expressions unique to American culture and often treats collective nouns as singular, as in "The team is winning." Finally, American English has absorbed influences from various languages, especially Spanish, contributing to its rich vocabulary and expressions
