At the beginning, big dreams and goals can feel overwhelming. You might think, "How could I ever do that?" But here's the thing—every great achievement once looked impossible too.

Whether it's learning a new language, starting a business, moving to a new country, or just getting through a tough time—it feels too big... until you do it.

The key is to start. Take one small step. Then another. And keep going. One day, you'll look back and realize, "Wow, I actually did it."

So if something feels out of reach right now, don't give up. Just remember—impossible is only temporary.

What's something that once felt impossible to you, but now you've done it? Or... what's next?
