**At a bookstore**


Today I wandered into a little bookstore, just to escape the noise for a while. The air smelled like paper and coffee—warm, calm, familiar.

I didn't go in looking for anything special, but somehow I always find something that feels like it's been waiting for me. I flipped through pages, read random lines, and felt that quiet magic only a bookstore has.

It reminded me that sometimes, you don't need a plan. You just need a peaceful space, a good story, and time to slow down.

Maybe tomorrow, I'll go back. Or maybe I'll finally start that book I bought months ago. Either way, today felt soft. And I liked that.
