"Love yourself first and everything else falls into line."

When you truly love yourself, everything around you starts to shift. You stop chasing validation, you set better boundaries, and you attract the kind of people and experiences that reflect your worth.

Self-love isn't about being perfect—it's about accepting who you are, flaws and all. It's about speaking kindly to yourself, taking care of your mind and body, and choosing what's best for you. Once you start treating yourself with love and respect, you naturally make better decisions. You stop settling. You stop comparing. And slowly, life begins to feel more balanced, more peaceful, more you.

So before anything else—start with love. Your own. ✨ Because everything else? It follows. ✨
