English is spoken in many countries around the world. It connects people from different cultures and backgrounds. There are many kinds of English, with many different accents.

No one way of speaking is the “right” way.

In the U.S., the U.K., Australia, and India, English sounds different. In Nigeria and Singapore, people speak English in their own unique styles. English often mixes with local languages, creating new forms.

More and more people are learning English every year. They use it for work, travel, and meeting new people.

You don’t have to sound like a native speaker. What matters is speaking clearly and with confidence.

English is a global language — and it belongs to everyone. It’s your language too.
