**No one will fight for you.**
**You must stand up for yourself.**
**Not everyone sees your value.**
**Some people will doubt you always.**

**But you know your own heart.**
**You feel your dreams inside you.**
**Don't wait for others to agree.**
**You don't need loud approval.**

**Start where you are right now.**
**Use what you have with courage.**
**Even when you fail, you learn.**
**Failing still builds your strength.**

**Keep going when it gets hard.**
**Rest, but don't give up.**
**Each step forward is a win.**
**You grow with every small move.**

**Be proud of your journey today.**
**Fight for your future with fire.**
**Because you are worth the fight.**
**Never stop believing in yourself.**
