    I love reading books in my free time. Every day,
    I try to read at least 30 minutes before going to bed.
    I enjoy reading different types of books, such as novels,
     adventure stories, and history books.
     Reading helps me relax and learn new things.
     I often go to the library to borrow books,
     and I sometimes buy books when there is a sale.
     My favorite place to read is in my room,
     where it's quiet and comfortable.
     I also like to talk to my friends about the books I read.
     Reading has become a good habit for me,
     and I try to read more books every month.
     It helps improve my English and my imagination.
     Do you like to read books?
