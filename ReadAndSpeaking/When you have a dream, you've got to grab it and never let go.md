"When you have a dream, you've got to grab it and never let go."

Dreams are what keep us moving forward. They give us something to hope for, something to work toward—even when things feel hard. But dreams don't just happen. You have to chase them, protect them, and believe in them, even when others don't.

There will be moments when you feel tired. When people doubt you. When progress feels slow. That's exactly when you have to hold on tighter. Because the moment you let go is the moment it starts to slip away.

Even if it takes time—even if the road is messy—what matters is that you keep going. Take small steps, keep learning, and remind yourself why you started. Your dream is yours for a reason. So grab it, hold it close, and don't let anything or anyone make you give it up.

So tell me—what's the dream you refuse to let go of?
