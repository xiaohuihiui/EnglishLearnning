Last night, I had a dream I was walking through a quiet city at dawn. The streets were empty, the sky just turning pink, and everything felt soft—like the world was holding its breath. I wasn’t rushing anywhere. I didn’t need to be anywhere. I just walked, letting the silence wrap around me like a blanket.

There was a small café with lights still on, even though no one was inside. I stood at the window for a moment, watching steam curl from a forgotten cup. It felt like the kind of dream you don't want to wake up from—not because anything big happened, but because nothing did. Just peace.

When I woke up, I couldn't remember much else. But I held onto that feeling. And somehow, all day, the world felt a little quieter. A little kinder.
