Today, I found myself thinking about peace—not the loud kind with speeches and promises, but the quiet kind that lives in small moments. A child laughing on a street corner. Two strangers sharing an umbrella in the rain. A family eating together without checking the time.

Sometimes, it feels like the world is always in a hurry, always in a fight. But I like to believe that peace is still out there, waiting in the spaces we forget to look. It’s not something we have to chase—it’s something we can grow, little by little, like planting seeds.

I don’t know if I’ll see a world without conflict in my lifetime. But I do know this: hope is a powerful thing. And maybe, just maybe, it starts with one person choosing to be kind, even when they don’t have to be.
